    <p><b>1. What is your project about? (A 1-2 word answer that describes your main focus, e.g., climate change)</b>
    </p>
    <p class="answer">TV series analysis.</p>
    <p><b>2. What is the data you plan to use? (A link to the dataset with one sentence describing it)</b></p>
    <p class="answer"><em>BoJack Horseman </em><a

    <img src="resources/bojackscript.png" class="scriptimage">
    <p class="answer"><em>Fig. 1</em></p>
    <p class="answer">As seen in Fig. 1, this dataset consists of the BoJack Horseman transcript, with each row
      consisting
      of the character‚Äôs name and the related line of dialogue spoken by the character.
      I might also use data from sites such as <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/bojack-horseman/season-6"
        target="_blank">Metacritic</a> with regards to the reception of the show, in terms of audience ratings.</p>
    <p><b>3. What is the question you plan to answer? (One sentence that ends with a question mark that could act like
        the
        title of your data story)</b></p>
    <p class="answer">Are audiences of the <em>BoJack Horseman</em> TV series drawn in by negative sentiments portrayed
      by
      dialogue in the show?</p>
    <p><b>4. Why is this an important question?</b></p>
    <p class="answer"><em>BoJack Horseman</em> was ranked first in IndieWire‚Äôs list of ‚ÄòBest Animated Series of All
      Time‚Äô
      , lauded for its ‚Äòspans of dialogue that bridge heartbreak and hilarity‚Äô and how it makes its audiences ‚Äòlaugh and
      cry in unprecedented amounts‚Äô (Travers & Nguyen, 2023). </p>
    <p class="answer">An investigation of the sentiments portrayed by <em>BoJack Horseman</em>‚Äôs ostensibly well-written
      dialogue is imperative when considering the popularity of the TV series, which has especially infected the younger
      generations‚Äîmillennials and Gen-Z. A study by YouGov America found that 77% of Millennial participants have heard
      of
      the show, and 40% of them liked it (2022). According to Tylt, Gen-Z and Millennials relate to the situations
      tackled
      by <em>BoJack Horseman</em>, which ‚Äòblends existential crises and extremely poor adult decision-making with the
      childishness of a typical cartoon‚Äô.</p>
    <p class="answer">Fans of the show have also been found relating to the main character, BoJack Horseman, although he
      was ‚Äònever meant to be a role model‚Äô ‚Äî the character inconveniences people around him through his actions, falls
      back on self-destructive habits, and is highly nihilistic‚ÄîThe Daily Star hence reminds viewers, ‚ÄúBoJack isn‚Äôt
      perfect, and if he can go to therapy, the least you can do is make sure you‚Äôre choosing better reasons to love the
      show‚Äù (Hasan, 2019). As such, audience‚Äôs preferences for negative sentiments portrayed by dialogue and main
      characters in the show could be indicative of their viewing habits.
      This would open up discussions about how such adult shows impact the emotions and even mental health of its
      audiences.
    </p>
    <p><b>5. Which rows and columns of the dataset do you plan to use, to answer this question? (Actual names of the
        values
        you plan to filter (rows) or subset (columns) the data on)</b></p>
    <p class="answer">I plan to use both columns of the dataset: 1) name of character and 2) line of dialogue. I will
      create these columns by splitting the data using a delimiter. I plan to then separate the rows of data based on
      episode, so as to conduct sentiment analysis on the episodes separately. Rows with missing character names will be
      filtered out. In some extreme cases (e.g. Season 4 Episodes 5 to 10), data from entire seasons will be removed if
      there is missing or broken data, to ensure that sentiment analysis can be conducted according to character for
      each
      episode.</p>
