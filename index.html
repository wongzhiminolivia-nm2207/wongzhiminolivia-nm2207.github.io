    <p></p>
    <h3>Week 9</h3>
    <p>This week, I focused on research to flesh out my project ideas and storyboard. Much of what I worked on was
      behind-the-scenes,
      especially since I was still preparing my data for cleaning and looking to train models for sentiment analysis. I
      temporarily input a
      histogram chart on my data story page as a placeholder for a future chart that I will work on.

    <h3><b>Week 10</b></h3>
    <p>The look of my site changed drastically this week. I revamped this site by amending my html and css code, giving
      it a more cohesive
      look that is easy on the eyes (I hope). I have added a nav bar, where links to my data story and other pages with
      my work have been included.
      I have also worked on my data by cleaning it and categorising it based on episodes (this took a while as I worked
      with a full dataset of
      all 6 seasons)! My idea has been tweaked slightly since Week 9. I will attempt sentiment analysis using Python
      soon, and might try out VADER
      (thank you Prof Kokil for the suggestion). Analysis will have to be done in batches (with my data split according
      to episodes and also character).

    <p><b>1. What is your project about? (A 1-2 word answer that describes your main focus, e.g., climate change)</b>
    </p>
    <p class="answer">TV series analysis.</p>
    <p><b>2. What is the data you plan to use? (A link to the dataset with one sentence describing it)</b></p>
    <p class="answer"><em>BoJack Horseman </em><a
        href="https://github.com/talaverak1/Python-Project/blob/master/Subtitles/ULTIMATEFINAL.csv"
        target="_blank">subtitles</a></p>
    <img src="resources/bojackscript.png" class="scriptimage">
    <p class="answer"><em>Fig. 1</em></p>
    <p class="answer">As seen in Fig. 1, this dataset consists of the <em>BoJack Horseman</em> transcript, with each row
      consisting
      of the character‚Äôs name and the related line of dialogue spoken by the character.
      I might also use data from sites such as <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/bojack-horseman/season-6"
        target="_blank">Metacritic</a> with regards to the reception of the show, in terms of audience ratings.</p>
    <p><b>3. What is the question you plan to answer? (One sentence that ends with a question mark that could act like
        the
        title of your data story)</b></p>
    <p class="answer">Are audiences of the <em>BoJack Horseman</em> TV series drawn in by negative sentiments portrayed
      by
      dialogue in the show?</p>
    <p><b>4. Why is this an important question?</b></p>
    <p class="answer"><em>BoJack Horseman</em> was ranked first in IndieWire‚Äôs list of ‚ÄòBest Animated Series of All
      Time‚Äô, lauded for its ‚Äòspans of dialogue that bridge heartbreak and hilarity‚Äô and how it makes its audiences
      ‚Äòlaugh and
      cry in unprecedented amounts‚Äô (Travers & Nguyen, 2023). </p>
    <p class="answer">An investigation of the sentiments portrayed by <em>BoJack Horseman</em>‚Äôs ostensibly well-written
      dialogue is imperative when considering the popularity of the TV series, which has especially infected the younger
      generations‚Äîmillennials and Gen-Z. A study by YouGov America found that 77% of Millennial participants have heard
      of
      the show, and 40% of them liked it (2022). According to Tylt, Gen-Z and Millennials relate to the situations
      tackled
      by <em>BoJack Horseman</em>, which ‚Äòblends existential crises and extremely poor adult decision-making with the
      childishness of a typical cartoon‚Äô.</p>
    <p class="answer">Fans of the show have also been found relating to the main character, BoJack Horseman, although he
      was ‚Äònever meant to be a role model‚Äô ‚Äî the character inconveniences people around him through his actions, falls
      back on self-destructive habits, and is highly nihilistic‚ÄîThe Daily Star hence reminds viewers, ‚ÄúBoJack isn‚Äôt
      perfect, and if he can go to therapy, the least you can do is make sure you‚Äôre choosing better reasons to love the
      show‚Äù (Hasan, 2019). As such, audience‚Äôs preferences for negative sentiments portrayed by dialogue and main
      characters in the show could be indicative of their viewing habits.
      This would open up discussions about how such adult shows impact the emotions and even mental health of its
      audiences.
    </p>
    <p><b>5. Which rows and columns of the dataset do you plan to use, to answer this question? (Actual names of the
        values
        you plan to filter (rows) or subset (columns) the data on)</b></p>
    <p class="answer">I plan to use both columns of the dataset: 1) name of character and 2) line of dialogue. I will
      create these columns by splitting the data using a delimiter. I plan to then separate the rows of data based on
      episode, so as to conduct sentiment analysis on the episodes separately. Rows with missing character names will be
      filtered out. In some extreme cases (e.g. Season 4 Episodes 5 to 10), data from entire seasons will be removed if
      there is missing or broken data, to ensure that sentiment analysis can be conducted according to character for
      each
      episode.</p>

    <h3><b>Week 11</b></h3>
    <p><b>Data</b></p>
    <p class="answer">I continue to work on my <em>BoJack Horseman</em> scripts as my dataset. I also consider using the <a
        href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/bojack-horseman" target="_blank">Metacritic</a>
      user reviews for each season of the series as data for one of my charts as well. After conducting sentiment
      analysis on the script,
      the new dataset would be the compound sentiment scores of the lines of dialogue in the dataset, grouped together
      according to episode,
      season, and specific characters. Compound sentiments are determined by the percentage scores of positive and
      negative sentiment respectively.</p>
    <p><b>Visualisations</b></p>
    <p class="answer">I plan to use a pie chart to display what proportion of the total amount of dialogue can be
      attributed to each
      main character.
      From this, I hope to show that the main character, BoJack, bears the most amount of dialogue, and hence carries
      much of the show.</p>
    <p class="answer">From there, I will utilise line graphs or perhaps histograms, to showcase the change in sentiment
      across
      episodes,
      and across seasons. I might focus on only Season 1 and Season 6 to plot the change in sentiment across
      episodes‚Äîthis
      would serve as a direct comparison between the start and end of the TV series, to allow for analysis of how the
      show has
      potentially evolved. </p>
    <p class="answer">Alternatively, I will add a button that allows for a change in visualisations. Users can then
      cycle through donut
      charts
      of the sentiment make-up of each season. However, I am unsure about this method as it would not allow for a clear
      visual
      comparison of change over time (across seasons). </p>
    <p class="answer">If I have time, I will visualise example lines of dialogue that have been analysed to be placed
      under the
      positive/negative/neutral sentiment baskets. This would potentially be interactive, whereby users can hover over
      segments
      of the sentences to see which words or characters implicate the overall sentiment score of the sentence.</p>
    <p class="answer">I will also use bar graphs to plot change in sentiment specific to BoJack‚Äôs dialogue across
      seasons, to
      potentially
      illuminate any character development. In the bar graphs, I will try to display the proportion of negative and
      positive
      sentiment of BoJack per season, and add a line over the bars to display the compound sentiment scores. This
      ultimately
      serves as an indication of how the show chooses to portray its main character over time. As a form of comparison,
      I might
      plot another line on the same graph to display another main character‚Äôs change in sentiment across seasons. I will
      choose
      Mr. Peanutbutter, an ostensibly carefree, happy-go-lucky secondary character, to make comparisons between any
      change or
      non-change in character. </p>
    <p class="answer">I will consider plotting user ratings across episodes using either a bar graph or a line graph.
      However, I am still thinking about how to actively compare, visually, the user ratings per episode and the
      sentiment of the
      respective episodes. </p>
    <p><b>Errors faced</b></p>
    <p class="answer">I am currently in the midst of trying out sentiment analysis on my script data. However, I have
      faced many errors
      on my
      Google Colab. I am using VADER‚Äôs SentimentIntensityAnalyser to carry out sentiment analysis. I had issues reading
      my .csv
      file in pandas, and had to use ‚Äòencoding='unicode_escape'‚Äô to avoid an error. I am also stuck on trying to apply
      the sentiment analyser
      on my chosen column of data (column with dialogue) as the error ‚ÄòAttributeError: 'float' object has no attribute
      'encode'‚Äô is thrown.
      It confuses me, as my data does not seem to be of the float type (it is all text). I am still in the midst of
      solving this!</p>
    <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
    <p class="answer">Furthermore, I am still thinking about whether I have chosen the most effective visualisations
      (bar, line,
      histogram‚Ä¶),
      and which platform to use. I know that we are encouraged to use chart.js, but d3 looks interesting too. There is
      also
      flourish.studio, but since there is not much coding involved with this data visualisation tool, I am not sure if
      it would be
      alright for this project. </p>

    <h3><b>Week 12</b></h3>
    <p><b>Data</b></p>
    <p class="answer">I have finally completed sentiment analysis using Python ‚Äî I had faced many issues e.g.
      attributeError, data type
      issues‚Ä¶
      but I now have my analysed data in a csv file (thank you Jeremiah for da help).</p>
    <p class="answer">I added a new column to this dataset to specify which season and episode each line of dialogue
      stemmed from.
      It was hard to accomplish this in an efficient way, but I found an interesting work-around using formulas on
      Sheets to try
      and do this as quickly as possible. I hope this turns out to be useful‚Ä¶</p>
    <img src="resources\sentimentdata.png" class="answer" style="width: 420px">
    <p class="answer"><em>My current data and how I categorised it by season and episode</em></p>
    <p><b>Data story</b></p>
    <p class="answer">I have been trying to plan out my visualisations and how to go about telling the data story.
      I have quickly sketched out the assets that I will try to implement on my website.</p>
    <img src="resources\sketchedassets.jpg" class="answer" style="width: 500px">
    <p class="answer">I am considering doing a scroll site using <a
        href="https://pudding.cool/process/introducing-scrollama/" target="_blank">scrollama</a>,
      but will just position these assets in order instead if I do not have the time.</p>
    <p><b>Progress</b></p>
    <p class="answer">I have started on the flip cards for my data story.</p>
    <p class="answer">I have also added a pie chart, my first visualisation using Chartjs.</p>
    <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
    <p class="answer">Making the flip cards produced a lot of errors. I had to add several divs and add
      classes to create the 'flip' effect for the entire card (not just the text). Aligning the text to
      center was also difficult, and I still have not properly vertically aligned it to center. But it looks
      decent to me for now!</p>
    <p class="answer">
      I realised that the fetch api method only works with remote files, so I need to get my
      local csv file (dataset) hosted before I move on to create more charts using Chartjs.
