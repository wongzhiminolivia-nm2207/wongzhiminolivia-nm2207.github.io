            it is a show about a deeply depressed and lost individual trapped in Hollywood.' </p>

        <h2>Don't act on your emotions just yet</h2>
        <p>I have explored the sentiments portrayed in <em>BoJack Horseman</em>,
            and derived that its main character,
            BoJack, is
            typically portrayed expressing himself negatively through dialogue.</p>
        <p>Indeed, this might be telling of the show's viewers' preferences and
            character. If
            you are one of the loyal fans of <em>BoJack Horseman</em>, or if you feel that BoJack's character resonates
            strongly with
            you, you might
            want to start thinking about what that means now, in light of this data story. Maybe it is time to start
            going for
            therapy, instead of using animated characters as an outlet to work through your issues...just kidding!
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:larger">üòäüòêü•≤</p>
        <p>There are many caveats and things that need to be acknowledged with this data story.</p>
        <p>Firstly, sentiment analysis conducted by AI is likely not fully accurate. The
            sentiment analysis that I carried out had neglected certain context, such as the visual content of the scene
            at
            the time
            of each line of dialogue being executed.</p>
        <p>Secondly, sentiment analysis isn't the be-all and end-all of judging a show's portrayal of its themes and
            characters.
            One would likely find such categorisation of sentiments overly polar and insufficient in properly capturing
            the nuances of
            emotions portrayed on screen, especially when it comes
            to <a
                href="https://theconversation.com/netflixs-bojack-horseman-is-one-of-the-most-complex-animated-characters-ever-created-103932"
                target="_blank" class="wobble">complex</a>,
            multi-layered shows such as <em>BoJack Horseman</em>.
        </p>
        <h3 style="font-size:16px;font-weight:lighter">Find out more about sentiment analysis, its pros and cons, and
            more, <a href="https://research.aimultiple.com/sentiment-analysis-methods/" target="_blank"

        <img src="resources/horsinaroundtransparent.png" style="width:25%;padding-left:80px;padding-right:80px;">
        <p>Some episodes of data had to be left out in my datasets, due to incomplete parts of the
            transcript data. Hence, this is still not quite the <em>full</em> picture.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, correlation definitely does not equal to causation. I definitely do not suggest that viewers of
            the show/fans
            who relate to BoJack Horseman possess such preferences due to the show's negativity. There are many other
            aspects of the
            show to enjoy or relate to, and without proper survey or other methods, there is no way of determining
            whether the show's
            portrayed sentiments have any effect on its viewership/viewers' behaviour.
        </p>
        <p>Nevertheless, if this data story has prompted you towards some reflection that has revealed personal findings
            that align with
            what I propose through this data story, I hope that you are feeling okay.
        </p>
        <p>The show deals with many hard-hitting themes, such as existentialism, addiction, depression and more. This
            adult animated
            series might not be suitable for all, especially those in vulnerable mental states. If you do find yourself
            turning
            to such shows as an outlet, or if you <a
                href="https://www.quora.com/I-watched-Bojack-Horseman-and-now-Im-sad-What-do-I-do" target="_blank"
                class="wobble">feel upset after
                watching</a> or learning about the show's contents, do know that help is
            always available if you need it. </p>
