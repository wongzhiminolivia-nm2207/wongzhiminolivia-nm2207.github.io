V/O: Horsin' Around is filmed before a live studio audience.

ENT: Kitchen of an 80's furnished house

Bojack is in a loud orange sweatshirt doing dishes and young Sarah plops down at the table in a bad mood

SABRINA: [sighs] Mondays.

BOJACK: [laughs] Well, good morning to you too.

SABRINA: Oh, hey.

BoJack drops his plate and looks around for some hay; Sarah giggles

BOJACK: Where? I'd love hay.

ENT: Charlie Rose interviewing BoJack

CHARLIE ROSE: In 1987, the situation comedy Horsin' Around premiered on ABC.

BoJack is shown sharing a giant bowl of ice cream with a happy family; in another picture he is eating it all to himself and the family is sad

CHARLIE ROSE: The show, in which a young, bachelor horse is forced to reevaluate his priorities when he agrees to raise three human children, was initially dismissed by critics as broad and saccharine and not good, but the family comedy struck a chord with America and went on to air for nine seasons. The star of Horsin' Around, BoJack Horseman, is our guest tonight.
Welcome, BoJack.

BOJACK: It is good to be here, Charlie. Sorry I was late. The traffic-

CHARLIE ROSE: It's really no problem.

BOJACK: I parked in a handicapped spot. I hope that's okay.

CHARLIE ROSE: You parked in a-

BOJACK: I'm sorry, disabled spot. Is that the proper nomenclature?

CHARLIE ROSE: Maybe you should move the car.

BOJACK: No, I don't think I should drive right now. I'm incredibly drunk.

CHARLIE ROSE: You're telling me that you're drunk right now?

BOJACK: Is it just me, or am I nailing this interview? I kind of feel like I'm nailing it.

CHARLIE ROSE: Yes. Anyway, we were talking about Horsin' Around.
To what do you attribute the show's wide appeal?

BOJACK: Charlie, listen, you know, I know that it's very hip these days to shit all over Horsin' Around, but at the time, I can tell you - Is it okay to say "shit"? -

CHARLIE ROSE: Please don't.

BOJACK: 'Cause I I think the show's actually pretty solid for what it is.
It's not Ibsen, sure, but look, for a lot of people, life is just one long, hard kick in the urethra, and sometimes when you get home from a long day of getting kicked in the urethra, you just want to watch a show about good, likable people who love each other, where, you know, no matter what happens, at the end of 30 minutes, everything's gonna turn out okay.
You know, because in real life Did I already say the thing about the urethra?

CHARLIE ROSE: Well, let's talk about real life. What have you been doing since the show's cancellation?

BOJACK: That's a great question, Charlie.
I, uh Uh, I Um

CROWD Maury! Maury! Maury! Maury!

Maury Povich is on the television delivering the 'bad' news to a turtle, who promptly hides in his shell

MAURY: In the case of one-year-old Phoenix, you are the father.

In Bojacks house

TODD: Morning, sunshine.

BOJACK: [groans]

TODD: Why so gloomy, roomie?

BOJACK: First of all, we're not roommates. You are my houseguest.

TODD: Well, we don't need to put labels on things.

BOJACK: You sleep on my couch, and you don't pay rent. I've had tapeworms that were less parasitic.
I don't even remember why I let you stay with me in the first place.


TODD: Because my parents kicked me out, and I had nowhere to go, and even though you don't want anyone to know it-

Bojack prepares himself a smoothie of carrots, vitamins,and vodka for breakfast

[blender whirring]

Bojack purposely cuts off Todd with the blender. Todd patiently waits to resume speaking

TODD: You secretly have a good heart.

BOJACK: You told me they didn't approve of your "alternative lifestyle.
I thought you were, like, a troubled gay teen or something.
I didn't realize by "alternative lifestyle" that you meant you were lazy.

TOD: That's on you for making assumptions. Also, if you're looking for the Toaster Strudels, I got really high last night and ate them all.

BOJACK: [sighs]

TODD: Did you say you've had tapeworms?

[upbeat music]

ENT: Diner

A raccoon is rummaging through a dumpster and disturbs another raccoon

PINKY: Thanks for meeting me here.
I would have invited you to my office, but the electric company shut off our power.

BOJACK: That's unfortunate.

PINKY: Just an issue with the bank and a lack of money in it. Now, as you know, Penguin is very eager to publish your memoirs, but you keep missing your deadlines.

BOJACK: I know, and I'm sorry, but I am making great progress.

Flashback to Bojack in his office lazily speaking into a tape recorder. A whole day goes by and he hasn't gotten anywhere

BOJACK: BoJack Horseman: The BoJack Horseman Story, written by BoJack Horseman.
Chapter one.
Chapter one.
Chapter One.

PINKY: Look, we really need a bestseller here at Penguin. Things are not that great for me, money wise.

BOJACK: Aren't you an editor at a major publishing house?

PINKY: Yeah, a publishing house. When was the last time you saw a book?

BOJACK: I thought I saw someone reading one in the park the other day, but it turned out it was a takeout menu.

WAITRESS: Whenever you're ready.

PINKY: [clears throat]

BOJACK: [sighs]

Bojack pulls out his wallet to cover the tab

PINKY: We're living month to month here. We're kind of counting on your autobiography to save the company, no pressure.

BOJACK: That's actually a lot of pressure.

PINKY: Have you considered working with a ghostwriter?

BOJACK: Ugh, no, thank you. Look, just give me one more week, and I will give you some pages that'll knock your ass back to the South Pole.

PINKY: I'm from Cincinnati. It - that doesn't matter. I'll call you in a week.

BOJACK: Yes, one week. I'm telling you, this book is a top priority for me.

ENT: Bojack's living room

Bojack is drinking a beer and watching a rerun of 'Horsin' Around; his cell phone rings and he ignores it

BOJACK: Oh, right. Yeesh.

BOJACK ON TV: You're wearing that to the prom?

SARAH: What, you don't think it's cute?

BOJACK ON TV: Neigh way, Jose.

BOJACK: [laughs] "Neigh way, Jose." I improvised that line.
I mean, it was written, but I gave it the old BoJack spin.

TODD: Hey, how many times have you watched this episode?

BOJACK: Yeah, but do you get it, though? Because "nay" means no, but it's also a thing that horses say.
It works on every level.

TODD: I get it.

BOJACK: Ah, you don't get it.

[cheerful music on TV] Three little orphans One, two, three Without a home Or a family tree Until this horse said "Live with me" And now we've got A new family We were lost And now we're found And we're Horsin' around [neighs]

BOJAC: [belches]

TODD: Are you drunk?

BOJACK: Todd, I weigh over 1,200 pounds. It takes a lot of beer to get me drunk.

Camera pans out to show 48 beers and a tapped keg

Yes.

TODD: Ah, yeah, I see. You're just bummed out because Princess Carolyn dumped you last night.

ENT: At a fancy diner 10 hours earlier

[jazz music]

CAROLYN: BoJack, we need to talk.

BOJACK: Hey, check out the rug on that guy.

A turtle is sitting with two attractive women

TURTLETAUB: Slow and steady, am I right, ladies? [girls giggle] Ha-cha-cha.

BOJACK: Who does he think he's fooling? Turtles don't have hair.

CAROLYN: Stop embarrassing me. That is Lenny Turteltaub.

BOJACK: You know, I am not crazy about the bread here.
Mm. Why do I keep eating it?

CAROLYN: BoJack, can you please just listen for a second?

BOJACK: You have my undivided attention.

Bojack grabs another piece of bread

CAROLYN: I think we should see other people.

BOJACK: Were we not seeing other people?

Bojack is getting some tang while an episode of 'Horsin' Around' is playing

GIRL: [moaning] BoJack, I'm almost there.

BOJACK: Wait. Shh! Shut up.

BOJACK ON TV: Now, that's a horse of a different - cruller?

On tv out of context we see Bojack hold up a donut. He has an orgasm to the punchline of his joke

BOJACK: Oh! God, that's good comedy.

Return to dinner.

CAROLYN: BoJack!

BOJACK: What? Everyone gets a mulligan, and my mulligan was Carey Mulligan.
I'm kidding, jeez.
It was Emily Mortimer.

CAROLYN: [scoffs]

BOJACK: What is the problem here? Are you embarrassed of me because I'm a has-been? Because you know that I'm writing that book that is gonna make everybody love me again.

CAROLYN: You're not really writing a book.

BOJACK: Well, I already spent my advance, so that's a first step.

CAROLYN: Look, this has been a lot of fun, but I need to start thinking about my future.
I mean, you don't even respect me enough to have a baby with me.

BOJACK: Whoa, what? I never explicitly said that.

CAROLYN: You said it with your actions.

BOJACK: What actions?

ENT: The sidewalk, a woman with a stroller appears

CAROLYN: Oh, look at that baby. Isn't he the cutest baby you ever saw?

Bojack gets 'spooked' and begins to panic trampling everything in his path

BOJACK: What? What? What? No, no, wha [horn honks] [glass shatters] [car door opens and closes] [engine turns over] [tires squealing] [glass shattering] [engine revving] [tires screeching] [loud crash] [sirens blaring]

COP: Step away from the stolen vehicle, sir!

BOJACK: No, no, no. Misunderstanding, officer.
I was running away from my girlfriend whom I don't respect enough to have a baby with.

COP: Hey, aren't you the horse from Horsin' Around?

ENT: Back at the diner

CAROLYN: Oh, face it.
You're afraid of commitment.

BOJACK: I'm not afraid of commitment. I commit to things all the time.
It's the following through on that commitment that I take issue with.

CAROLYN: Hey, stupid, isn't that your friend over there? Oh, Mr.

BOJACK: Peanutbutter? God, I hope he doesn't see us.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Is that BoJack Horseman?

BOJACK: Oh, jeez, here we go.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Mr. Peanutbutter and BoJack Horseman in the same room.
What is this, a crossover episode?

BOJACK: You know, that gets funnier every time.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You're being sarcastic, but I think it does actually get funnier every time.

BOJACK: We're actually in the middle of breaking up right now... so if you could just

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yeah? You're in the middle of it?

BOJACK: Yeah, that's right.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: So would it be awkward if I joined you right now?

BOJACK: Yes, actually, it's very awkward. Is that not clear?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yeah, this is awkward right now?

Mr. Peanutbutter pulls up a chair

BOJACK: Yes, please leave.

CAROLYN: How are you, Mr.Peanutbutter?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, living the dream, P.C., living the dream.

BOJACK: Why are you making conversation?

CAROLYN: Oh, let's see, it's the English word: It's called being polite, BoJack.

BOJACK: But am I crazy that this is a bad time?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Always a Clydesdale, never a Clyde, eh, BoJack?

BOJACK: What?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You'll get that one later, man.

Heads offscreen

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Erica, get out of here with that face!

CAROLYN: Would it kill you to be civil? This is why we're breaking up.

BOJACK: So it's not because of the thing with the baby?

CAROLYN: It's because of a lot of things! Waiter, could we please have the check? Thank you.

BOJACK: We haven't even ordered yet.

CAROLYN: I have wasted so many dinners on you, BoJack Horseman. I don't know how you can expect anyone else to love you when you so clearly hate yourself.

WAITER: Here you go.

BOJACK: Let me see that. [Shouting] $10 for bread?

Outside a bunch of pigeons fly away

BOJACK: I don't want to live in a society where the pre-meal bread isn't free.

WAITER: It is free if you order a meal.

CAROLYN: Can you take me home, please?

BOJACK: Yeah, but I didn't even eat that much bread. What did I have? I must have had-

WAITER: You ate nine baskets, sir.

BOJACK: Nine really? Great, now I'm gonna feel like a fat ass all week.

ENT: Driving home in car

BOJACK: You've seen me naked. Do you think I'm getting chubby?

CAROLYN: You want to know the real reason we're breaking up?

BOJACK: What was that? Sorry. Couldn't hear you over the sound of my calories not metabolizing.

CAROLYN: This is so classic you. You're using this bread thing to avoid talking about our relationship.

BOJACK: No, that is definitely not happening.

CAROLYN: I'd like to go home now.

BOJACK: You think I'm fat.

ENT: Bojack's living room

BOJACK: So yeah, technically I was dumped, but the real headline of the evening was, "Dumb guy eats bread, gets fat, the end."

TODD: What kind of headline is that?

BOJACK: Wasn't there a pizza here a second ago? God damn it! Stop the presses.

TODD: You're not fat. Oh, hey, let's throw a party. That'll cheer you up.

BOJACK: No, it won't. It'll cheer you up.

BOJACK: I'll stand in the corner by myself eating cotton candy until I barf like I did at your last party.

Flashback to Bojack puking on someone

STRANGER: Hey, aren't you the horse from Horsin' Around?

BOJACK: [retching]

TODD:That was a good party. Hey, didn't we get a cotton candy machine for that party?

BOJACK: Who told you Princess Carolyn and I broke up?

TODD: She did.

BOJACK: What?

CAROLYN: You never took me home, jerk!

BOJACK: Oh, everything's my fault.

CAROLYN: Take me home.

BOJACK: Okay, jeez. But I'm not looking for parking in Silver Lake.
I'll slow the car down to a crawl, and you can duck and roll.

CAROLYN: You know what, you can take a last look at this face, because it's the last time you're gonna see it-
Hey-up! [screams]

Bojack pushes her out of a moving car, but like a cat, she lands on her feet.

OPERATOR: [cell phone vibrates] [upbeat tune plays] Hello? I've got Princess Carolyn for you.

BOJACK: Uh, okay.

CAROLYN: BoJack.

BOJACK: Oh, my God, we just broke up.

CAROLYN: Yeah, but I'm still your agent. I pride myself on my ability to separate my professional life from my personal life.

BOJACK: Great. Then, as my agent, do you think I'm getting fat?

CAROLYN: No way. You are in the prime of your life, never looked better.

BOJACK: What about as my ex-girlfriend?

CAROLYN: You look like a pile of crap ate a second pile of crap and then crapped out a third pile of crap.

BOJACK: Wait, wait, so which pile of crap do I look like?

CAROLYN: The third one.

BOJACK: What? That's the worst one.

CAROLYN: I'm not calling you as your ex. I'm calling you as your agent.
Remember that book you're pretending to write? Well, Penguin wants an update on your progress.
Does Tuesday work for you, or are you gonna be too busy this week masturbating to old pictures of yourself?

BOJACK: I told you, that's not what was happening that time. I was masturbating to what the picture represented.
You walked in at the worst possible moment!

CAROLYN: So, Tuesday, though?

BOJACK: Yes, fine!

[laid-back rock music] ENT: Penguin HQ

Penguins are running around slding on their bellies

PINKY: You don't have anything?

BOJACK: Hey, you got the electricity back. Good for you.

An employee commits suicide and lands on a car cause in the alarm to go off, Pinky shuts the blinds

PINKY: This company is in dire straits. [screams] [alarm blares] We made a series of very bad investments.
Ever hear of a young adult franchise called the Swamp Monsters of Malibu?

BOJACK: Uh, no.

PINKY: Then why did we spend $20 million on marketing?
Cries and slams on his desk
It's okay, Pinky, go to your happy place.
Uh Look, I know you're a busy guy.

BOJACK: Actually, I am a busy guy. I live a very active lifestyle.

ENT: Bojack's living room, he's watching T.V

SARAH LYNN: : Can't I just stay home with you?

BOJACK ON TV: I know kindergarten is scary, but you're a big girl now, and you have to be brave.

SARAH LYNN: Okay, Daddy.

BOJACK ON TV: Wait, did you just call me "Daddy"?

BOJACK: Little Sabrina grew up right before our eyes, right, Todd? Todd? Todd!

TODD: What?

BOJACK: Did Sabrina grow up before our eyes?

TODD: Yes!

ENT: Pinky's office

PINKY: [clears throat] We're tired of waiting. We're hiring you a ghostwriter.

BOJACK: Diane "Nugent"?

PINKY: She's great, and she's got a thing for horses. Check this out.

Hands Bojack a book

BOJACK: Hey, Secretariat. You know, I always wanted to play Secretariat in a movie.
He's kind of my personal hero. Could never get the project off the ground, though.
I mean, there was this one time I came close in the '90s, but then those pre-Fontaine movies came out and people got tired of seeing him running on-screen.

PINKY: Don't tell me. Tell her!

BOJACK: She's cute.

PINKY: Call her. That's a loan, by the way.
We can't afford to be giving out free books to people, but you can take anything you want from the Swamp Monsters swag box.
[electricity crackles]

ENT: Bojack's living room

BOJACK: Oh, God, I'm a failure.

TODD: Oh, you're not a failure.

BOJACK: Why did I say I could write a book?

TODD: Because you have an amazing story to tell. Relax.

BOJACK: Relax? Easy for you to say, you hippie. You've never had a day of stress in your life.

Flashback to a dark room, Todd is getting pummeled by a rhino

TODD: Ow. Why?

MOB BOSS: And that's for trying to sell E on the cartel's turf.

TODD: [coughs] Oh, where's Gabriela?

MOB BOSS: She went back to Mexico City, ese, to be with her husband.

TODD: What? No! - Gabriela, why?

BOJACK: Who? We were talking about me. Can you try to focus for, like, a second?

TODD: Oh, yeah, sorry. You were saying?

BOJACK: Never should have signed this book deal. You know what my problem is? I can't say no to people because I want everyone to like me.

TODD: You want everyone to like you?

BOJACK: Yeah, why? Do people not like me?

TODD: for 10 minutes Uh Uh What were we talking about?

BOJACK: I can see the headline now, "Stupid BoJack writes a stupid book about his stupid life, nobody cares."

TODD: What newspapers are you reading?

CAROLYN: Hey, why don't you just let that lady write your book and be done with it?

BOJACK: Better question, why are you in my kitchen?

CAROLYN: I'm making breakfast. We had sex last night, dummy.

BOJACK: Ugh, I really got to start putting my phone on airplane mode when I drink.

CAROLYN: [hisses]

BOJACK: This lady probably thinks I'm just some dumb sitcom actor.
I hate her and her stupid, impossible-to-pronounce last name, Na-goo-ya-go-goo-goo-goo-ga.

TODD: You haven't even met her. Give her a chance. Oh, you should invite her to the party.

BOJACK: What party? Why are you so obsessed with throwing a party all of a sudden?

Flashback to Todd getting beat up by the rhino again

TODD: Ow, ow, ow!

MOB BOSS: You know how much money we lost 'cause of you? I can't even afford a hall now for my daughter's 15th birthday, and now I got a hundred guests coming and nowhere to put them. You owe me a party, cabrÃ³n, and if you don't deliver [muffled whimpers] [gunshot]

Mob Boss shoots rabbit with bag over it's head

ENT: Bojack's living room
TODD: Because parties are fun?

BOJACK: This book is really important to me. I don't want to just hand it off to some stranger.

CAROLYN: If it's so important, why have you written literally nothing in a year and a half?

BOJACK: It's too much pressure. This book is my one shot at preserving my legacy.
I'm a joke, and if this book isn't good, I'm gonna be a joke forever.
Everyone thinks that I'm just this washed-up hack, but actually Oh, God, actually, what if they're right? I can't breathe.
Am I dying? Toast. I smell burning toast!

CAROLYN: Oh, my God, my toast!

BOJACK: [Dying] Todd, on my grave, I want it to say that I was born in 1975.

TODD: No one's gonna believe-

BOJACK: Damn it, can't you respect a dying man's wish?

TODD: You're not dying.

ENT: Hospital on a t.v. screen

DOCTOR: [monitor beeping] [steady tone] [groans] [sighs] Well, we did everything we could.
Nurse, record the time of death. It doesn't get easier. It never gets easier.

SABRINA: [both sigh] [Sabrina crying] What I don't What do you mean he's dead?

DOCTOR: That's right, sweetheart. He died of a broken heart because you didn't appreciate him enough, and now he's gone forever.

BOJACK: We might have gone too dark on that series finale.

DOCTOR: I'm required to hand you over to the child protective services.
You're the state's problem now.

[crowd] No! [TV turns off]

ENT: Hospital

TODD: Do you just take those DVDs with you everywhere you go?

BOJACK: Linus walked around with a blanket. No one gave him shit for it.

CAROLYN: How long is that doctor going to take? I have a meeting with another client at 3:00.

BOJACK: You have other clients?

CAROLYN: No, I make a living off you sitting on your ass all day.

BOJACK: Are your other clients more talented than I am? Your silence speaks volumes.

CAROYLN: That was my intention

PIG DOCTOR: Well, BoJack, it looks like what you experienced was a mild anxiety attack.

BOJACK: Jesus, if that's mild, I don't want to know what spicy feels like.
Too smart for the room? It was a salsa joke, people.

PIG DOCTOR: You've been overstressed. I need you to take it easy.

CAROLYN: Take it easy, are you kidding? He doesn't have a job. He has no real responsibilities.
He doesn't do anything but take it easy.

PIG DOCTOR: Well, can you take it even easier?

BOJACK: I can try, doctor. I can try.

CAROLYN: This book deal is obviously stressing you out. Will you just call the ghostwriter already?

BOJACK: What, you want me to call this woman on the phone? [gasps]

10 minutes later

PIG DOCTOR: Well, you just had another anxiety attack.

BOJACK: And Entertainment Weekly said I wasn't consistent.
[laughs] Really, not even a pity laugh? I did almost die.

TODD: Ha.

PIG DOCTOR: I have to check on some other patients.

BOJACK: You have other patients?

TODD: BoJack, let's have a party, okay? I'll organize the whole thing. You can invite the ghostwriter and have a nice, casual conversation in a fun, pressure-free environment.

BOJACK: Okay, fine. We'll have a party.

TODD: Oh, thank God.

BOJACK: But we're not getting a cotton candy machine.
I can't control myself around those things.

TODD: I totally hear what you are saying, and I will do my best.

ENT: Huge party at Bojack's

[mariachi music] [singing in Spanish] [laughter] [cheering] [laughter]

MOB BOSS: Senor Horseman, I will never forget your generosity today. You have made a powerful ally for life. Mwah. Let's dance!

BOJACK: Todd, who was that guy? Who are all these people?

TODD: Oh, you know, just a variety of folks from all walks of life.

BOJACK: Is this a Quinceanera?

TODD: Oh, so any party with Mexican teenage girls is a Quinceanera? Now who's racist? [laughter]

A girl is hitting a horse pinata in front of a Quinceanera banner, there is a chihuahua girl next to her

BOJACK: I find that pinata offensive.

TODD: If you'll excuse me, I have a Virgin of Guadalupe pendant to present.

Bojack spots Diane but Mr. PeanutButter comes over
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: BoJack! Oh, good Lord.

BOJACK: Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Can you believe this, the two of us in the same house? Is this a crossover episode? No, I'm just kidding around, man. Seriously, though, how are you?

Bojack: Well, I've been kind of up and -

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: (Interrupting) Living the dream, huh? Yeah. Hey, we'll catch up later, all right? I want to talk to you. Erica, how are you looking so beautiful? I'm furious.

DIANE: Hey, BoJack, right? BoJack Horseman?

BOJACK: Yes. Oh, I'm I'm sorry, I don't want to mispronounce your name.

DIANE: It's Diane.

BOJACK: Oh, Diane.

DIANE: Thanks for inviting me to your party. Sorry I haven't really been mingling. I get kind of awkward at parties.

BOJACK: Have you tried alcohol?

DIANE: I don't know. Parties make me anxious in a real broad sense. Like, look at that guy. He's having fun. Why haven't I figured it out?

BOJACK: What guy?

DIANE: No, there's no guy there. I'm just saying, like, a guy, you know?

BOJACK: Oh, okay, yeah.

DIANE: I'm probably just overthinking it because I never got the practice because I didn't get invited to any parties in high school.
What am I talking about? You don't care about any of that. Shut up, Diane. You're at a party, compliment the host.
You have a lovely home.

BOJACK: Yeah, well, if you're gonna throw away most of your adult life on some dumb sitcom, you might as well get a sweet house out of the deal, right?

DIANE: So what are you working on these days?

BOJACK: Well, mostly I just sit around the house and complain about things.

DIANE: Yeah, how's that working out for you?

BOJACK: I can't complain, so you know.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: No, I will not have sex with you! This girl wants me to have sex with her. No, I'm just kidding around. You're a good sport.

BOJACK: Ugh, you know who that is?

DIANE: Mr. Peanutbutter?

BOJACK: Yeah, he was on that show Mr. Peanutbutter's House about that dog who adopted the three human kids.
What a dumb idea for a TV show.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You people are all right. Who wants an autograph?

BOJACK He's so stupid he doesn't realize how miserable he should be. I envy that.

DIANE: Hey, do you know the story of the dad from The Brady Bunch?

BOJACK: Do I know his story? If I recall correctly, he was bringing up three boys of his own.

DIANE: Right, but-

BOJACK: They were four men living all together, but they were all alone. That is profoundly sad.

DIANE: No, the story is that the guy who played the dad hated being on The Brady Bunch because he was a real actor, and he considered it beneath him. Sound familiar?

BOJACK: That's not all that was beneath him. Gay joke. Sorry, I'm better than that.

DIANE: Most people don't even get to do The Brady Bunch version of the thing they want to do with their lives. You're actually in a really good position now, because you can pretty much do anything you want. You're responsible for your own happiness, you know?

BOJACK: Good Lord, that's depressing.

DIANE: No, it's not.

BOJACK: I'm responsible for my own happiness? I can't even be responsible for my own breakfast.

Flashback to Bojack struggling to make his own cereal

BOJACK: Todd! I need help.

DIANE:What would make you happy?

BOJACK: Well, finishing my memoir, I guess.

DIANE: Is that all? I can help you with that.

BOJACK: Yeah? I mean, would you even want to? You'd have to spend a lot of time with me. You'd probably get sick of me.

DIANE: I don't think that's going to happen.

BOJACK: No?

DIANE: No, BoJack.

BOJACK: Okay. Well, then I guess you're hired, but don't put all that stuff about how sad I am in the book.

DIANE: Oh, that doesn't count. We weren't on the clock yet.

BOJACK: Yeah, exactly. You're only my ghostwriter starting nah - Starting now.

DIANE: You got it.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: BoJack!

BOJACK: Ugh, this guy.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hey, man, wanted to let you know, you are out of beer. Oh, I see you've met my beautiful girlfriend, Diane Nguyen.

BOJACK: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second. You drank all my beer? Also, you two are dating?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yeah.

BOJACK: You're dating him?

DIANE: Yes.

BOJACK: This is your boyfriend?

DIANE: That is correct.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Uh-huh.

BOJACK: You are going out with you?

BOTH: Uh-huh.

BOJACK: But in a sexual way, not just as friends?

DIANE: That's right.

BOJACK: You have seen her naked.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Many times, yes.

BOJACK: You are attracted to this?

DIANE: Yes.

BOJACK: This penis has been inside this vagina.

DIANE: Yep.

BOJACK: But in a sexual way.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, yes.

BOJACK: Humph. [retching] - Ugh. Oh, my God.
[retching]

DIANE: Are you okay?

BOJACK: I'm just [retching] I'm fine. I'm just I'm really happy for you. [retching]

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Should we get someone, or-

BOJACK: No, everything's Oh, this is really Wonderful. Oh, God. [retching] Starting now.

BoJack Hates the Troops (Script)

Bartender: Say "when."

(PAUSE)

BoJack: When.

Pam: (on the phone) Yeah, you'll never guess who's here—Think '90s—No, BoJack Horseman from Horsin' Around—No, I mean, he got a little fatter, but it's definitely him. He looks really sad. It's hilarious. (laughs) Get over here now.

BoJack: (on phone) I told you, I don't know where it is. Don't put things in my butt if you want them back.

Laura: And hold for Princess Carolyn, please.

BoJack: Thanks, Laura.

    "When you're walking alone" 
    "Because Jellicles are" 
    "And Jellicles do" 
    "Jellicles do and Jelli—" 

Princess Carolyn: BoJack, it's your favorite agent.

BoJack: Yeah, some agent, you couldn't even get me in the room for War Horse. There were, like, ten horses in that movie. I didn't need to be the warhorse.

Princess Carolyn: Listen, dummy, I want to make sure you're all set for your first day with Diane tomorrow.

BoJack: Is she gonna ask me a bunch of personal questions?

Princess Carolyn: The woman we're paying to ghostwrite your memoir? Yeah, probably.

BoJack: Okay, all right, there's no need to get—

Princess Carolyn: What, catty? Are you gonna say "catty"

BoJack: I was not gonna say "catty."

Princess Carolyn: Oh, what were you gonna say?

BoJack: I was gonna say "catty" because you're a cat.

Princess Carolyn: (not amused) Goodbye, BoJack.

BoJack: Laura, I know you're listening. You got it, right?

Princess Carolyn: Laura, do not respond to him. Goodbye, BoJack.

BoJack: She got it.

Girls: Oh, my God. Take another one. Take another one.

BoJack: Excuse me, [walks to two human girls and a female girl] I just wanted you to know that you ruined someone else's night tonight, and I hope you have enough decency to at least feel a little bit crappy about it.

Pam: Excuse me?

BoJack: I was actually already in a bad mood, but I thought maybe for one night, I could go out to a bar and try to forget about myself, but now because of you and your friends, I feel more self-conscious than ever.

Pam: If we were bothering you so much, why didn't you just leave?

BoJack: Because I didn't think of that, and now I feel stupid.

Pam: Look, I have a right to be here.

BoJack: No! [the chicken girl lays an egg] Maybe because you're skinny and maybe 'cause you're pretty, you're used to getting away with things, but I want you to know that your actions have an effect on others,and I hate you, and you are a horrible person, and you not understanding that you're a horrible person doesn't make you less of a horrible person.

Pam: (beat) You think I'm pretty?

    LATER 

BoJack: Well, that was another in a long series of regrettable life choices.

Pam: What'd you say? I was tweeting about all the weird stuff you do in bed.

    THEME 

Pam: Good morning.

BoJack: Ah! Why are you here?

Pam: I slept here.

BoJack: Yeah, but why are you still here?

Pam: Breakfast.

BoJack: That better not be my last Toaster Strudel.

Pam: No, there were three left.

BoJack: Well, get out of here. My memoirist is gonna show up soon, and I don't need you—What's your name?

Pam: Pam.

BoJack: I don't need you Pamm-ing up the place when she gets here.

Diane: Hey, BoJack.

BoJack: Ah! Why are you here?

Diane: You told me to come at nine.

BoJack: That doesn't sound like me.

Diane: I have your email right here. "Diane, why don't you come over Tuesday morning at nine? Also, you should bring this email with you, because I might not remember it, because I just took a bunch of horse tranquilizers, ha-ha. Also, please don't put in my book that I use horse tranquilizers, ha-ha. I just use a small dose to help me fall asleep at night and then a much, much larger dose to get me through the day. Also, I'm drunk. Also, I'm alone, so alone, so, so alone. Please don't put that in my book, book, book, book—'em, dildo. Does it taste like magenta in here?" Then I think you fell asleep on the keyboard because it just says the letter "b" twenty-seven times.

BoJack: That does sound like me. Well, anyway, this is my—business-person—

Pam: Excuse me?

BoJack: Here to help me with some business needs. All very above board.

Pam: Uh, what'd you say?

BoJack: No need to mention her in the book either, unless it's a business book.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Ha ha, classic BoJack.

BoJack: Why are you here?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Oh, funny story, I'm filming a reality show later, so I thought I'd drop by with the old tennis ball and chain.

BoJack: That is neither funny, nor a story, nor a reason for you to drop by.

Diane: Aw, he just wanted to come over and brag about his reality show.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Get this, I am starring in a pilot presentation for a celebrity reality show. It's pretty cutting edge, huh?

BoJack: Yeah, if it's 2003.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Ha ha. Don't tell VH1 that. Seriously, though, please don't tell VH1 that. We are calling it Peanutbutter and Jelly. Get it? Because I'm Mr. Peanutbutter.

BoJack: Okay, who's jelly?

Mr. Peanutbutter: No, no, no. It's like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. It's wordplay.

BoJack: You may have too forgiving a definition of the word "wordplay."

Mr. Peanutbutter: Well, it's a working title.

BoJack: Well, it could be working harder, and that's wordplay. How'd you even get in here?

Diane: Your roommate let us in.

Todd: "Mi casa es su casa."

BoJack: And that is the last of the Toaster Strudels, and now my morning is ruined.

Todd: Could you guys keep it down, okay? I'm kind of on a date right now. (speaks Japanese) "In America, I am actually considered very handsome."

BoJack: Okay, I'm gonna go get breakfast, and when I get back, I want everyone out of my house except for —you and you and—Who are you again?

Pam: The girl you had sex with.

BoJack: Right. You definitely should have already been gone.

    CUT, "J'VON'S" 

Poodle Lady: I really shouldn't eat chocolate 'cause it can literally kill me.

Corgi Lady: Oh, I know.

Poodle Lady: But I love chocolate.

Corgi Lady: Story of my life.

[Both laughing]

Neal McBeal: Hey, excuse me.

BoJack: Yes, I am BoJack Horseman, star of Horsin' Around.

Neal McBeal: Yeah, okay, I don't care. Those are my muffins.

BoJack: I'm sorry, I—I don't understand. Did you bring them into the store with you or?

Neal McBeal: No, but I was going to buy them. That's the last box, and I had dibs on them.

BoJack: Really? You had dibs?

Neal McBeal: Yeah, dibs. I just put them down for a second while I went to the bathroom.

BoJack: Look, I don't even want the muffins. I was just looking at them, but I got to say, if you put muffins down, they're not your muffins.

Neal McBeal: So what, I was supposed to take them into the bathroom with me?

BoJack: You didn't even put the muffins in a cart. You just left them out here.

Neal McBeal: Yeah, in the produce section. Clearly, muffins aren't supposed to be in the produce section. That wasn't a sign to you that maybe someone else had dibs?

BoJack: Look, I don't want to get into a whole thing here.

Neal McBeal: Then give me the muffins.

BoJack: No, 'cause maybe now I want the muffins.

Neal McBeal: You think that because you're a pseudo-celebrity, normal rules don't apply to you?

BoJack: Pseudo?! Would you say that to Eric McCormack? Look, I've had a rough morning, so I don't need—

Neal McBeal: You've had a rough morning? I spent the last ten months—Hey!

BoJack: Sorry, wasn't listening. See ya'.

Neal McBeal: You're going to regret this, BoJack Horseman.

BoJack: Oh, really? I'm gonna regret buying muffins? What, have they got a lot of saturated fat in them? Oh, man, they do have a lot of saturated fat. Why'd I buy these?

    LATER 

BoJack: Man, I really regret buying those muffins and then eating them all on the drive home.

Todd: Well, my date with Ayako went really well. Thanks for asking.

BoJack: I specifically didn't ask, and I'll thank you to respect my total lack of interest in your personal life.

Todd: She's hilarious. I never met a girl who was so curious about American bank routing numbers.

BoJack: Still not interested.

Diane: Should we get started on the book?

BoJack: What's your hurry?

Todd: What do you guys think I should get Ayako for our twelve-hour anniversary? She wants a framed picture of my mother's maiden name.

BoJack: Okay, let's get to work.

Diane: Let's start at the beginning. What was your childhood like?

BoJack: Normal.

Diane: Normal?

BoJack: Yeah, it was, uh, normal—normal childhood stuff.

    FLASHBACK 

Beatrice: Here's your omelet. I'm sorry it's not as good as the omelets your secretary makes, but then you're not married to your secretary, are you?

Butterscotch: Well, maybe if my secretary also refused to get an abortion, I would be.

BoJack (kid): Mommy, can I have an omelet?

Beatrice: You're the birthday boy.

    NOW: 

BoJack: Normal childhood, and then just get right into the big, famous part.

Diane: Look, if you're not ready to talk, we can wait

BoJack: I am ready to talk. Why wouldn't I want to talk about my parents? They're so normal. That's crazy. You sound like a crazy person, not me. Stop being so crazy, crazy. Why are you calling me crazy?

Diane: Okay. Was your father—

BoJack: Hold on, I got to take this. Hello?

Laura: Hey, BoJack, I've got Princess Carolyn for you. It's urgent.

BoJack: Great, put her on.

Laura: Just a sec. I'll see if she's available.

    "When you're walking alone" 
    "Because Jellicles are And Je—" 

Princess Carolyn: BoJack, are you watching MSNBSea right now?

BoJack: Great question. Well, I didn't fall down on my remote, randomly changing the channel to MSNBSea while simultaneously crippling myself, thus physically forcing me to watch MSNBSea, so no. No, I'm not watching MSNBSea right now.

Princess Carolyn: Yeah, well, Hamlet, you might want to turn it on. They're talking about you.

BoJack: Ooh! Good things, I hope.

Tom Jumbo-Grumbo:["live on MSNBSea"] Our guest via satellite is Neal McBeal, a naval officer on leave from Afghanistan. Welcome to the program, Neal.

Neal McBeal: Thank you, Tom.

BoJack: Hey, I met this guy.

Tom Jumbo-Grumbo: All Neal wanted when he got home and I emphasize, from Afghanistan was his favorite brand of breakfast muffins. When he went to the supermarket and called dibs on the last box -- Well, tell us what happened, Neal.

Neal McBeal: BoJack Horseman, from the '90s sitcom Horsin' Around, refused to respect my dibs.

Tom Jumbo-Grumbo: Have you no shame, BoJack Horseman? Seen here sneezing at a Christmas party.

BoJack: Oh, not the sneezing pic—Why do they always use the sneezing picture?!

Tom Jumbo-Grumbo: In the '90s, we laughed at your antics. Oh, how we laughed. "Ha ha ha," we chortled in rapturous glee. But when you deny the dibs called by our men and women on the frontlines, that is a sick joke, sir. A sick, sick joke, indeed, and you'll forgive me if I chortle no longer, for to me—there is nothing the least bit funny about stealing a meal from Neal McBeal, the Navy Seal. [blows out water]

Todd: Wait, wait, you stole muffins from a Navy Seal?

BoJack: I didn't know he was a Navy Seal. I just thought he was the regular kind of seal.

Neal McBeal: This is classic Hollywood elitism. BoJack Horseman thinks that because he was on TV, that makes him better than everybody. Well, guess what, BoJack, now I'm on TV, so now I'm better than everybody!

Tom Jumbo-Grumbo: That's right, Neal.

BoJack: You didn't even have dibs, you stupid sea cow. You guys think I should call in and set the record straight?

Diane: BoJack, these people feed off controversy. If you dignify the story with a response, it's just gonna fan—

Tom Jumbo-Grumbo: I'm now receiving word that we've got BoJack himself on the phone.

BoJack: Sorry, stopped listening. You were ramping up to a "yes," right?

Tom Jumbo-Grumbo: BoJack, what you did today was a slap in the face of America's heroes. Will, you, apologize?

BoJack: Okay, enough about America's heroes. Can we talk about dibs? Because he didn't even really have dibs. If he had legitimate dibs—

Neal McBeal: Oh, I had dibs on the muffins. I hid them in the produce section!

BoJack: You left them totally out in the open. That's hiding? How did you survive in Afghanistan?

Neal McBeal: Those are my muffins! You give me back my muffins!

BoJack: Hey, guess what, I can't give them back 'cause I ate them all, okay?

Todd: Dude.

Tom Jumbo-Grumbo: Hold on, just to be clear, since this morning, you ate all the muffins?

BoJack: Yeah, I ate them all in one sitting because I have no self-control and I hate myself. Is that what you want to hear?

Tom Jumbo-Grumbo: Neal, was it a small container of muffins, like two to four muffins?

Neal McBeal: No, Tom, there were a good deal more than that.

Tom Jumbo-Grumbo: Can you remember exactly how many muffins were in the box?

BoJack: Yeah, there were exactly twelve! I ate twelve muffins, and I didn't even want one! There's your goddamn news story, the mystery of my missing goddamn self-respect! How'd I come off?

Todd: Well, that went slightly better than the worst it could have possibly gone, so—hooray?

BoJack: It's not even about the muffins. Everyone is just out to get me because I'm famous and so well-adjusted.

Diane: Well, at least you've got some privacy. My boyfriend's filming a reality show at our house. If I want to be alone, I have to go to the roof because it's the only place they don't have insurance to film.

BoJack: You go on the roof?

Diane: Yeah, just to get some work done. Is that really weird?

BoJack: No, it's adorable.

Diane: When I was a kid, I used to climb onto the roof with my dad and look at the stars. What about you? Were you close with your father?

    FLASHBACK 

Young BoJack: Happy Father's Day, Daddy.

Butterscotch: What is this supposed to be, a Lima bean?

Young BoJack: It's a heart.

Butterscotch: That's some shoddy craftsmanship, son.

Young BoJack: I tried my best.

Butterscotch: No, you didn't. You slacked off and took the easy way out. In this world, you can either do things the easy way or the right way. You take a boat from here to New York, you gonna go around the horn like a gentleman or cut through the Panama Canal like some kind of democrat?

Young BoJack: Um, the canal?

Butterscotch: (slaps his son) You go around the horn the way God intended!

    NOW 

BoJack: Uneventful.

Diane: What?

BoJack: What?

Diane: I asked if you were close with your father, and you sat here in silence for five minutes and then said, "Uneventful."

BoJack: You know what, this is a really good conversation, and I definitely want to keep having it, but I just keep thinking about the muffins thing, so maybe we could put a pin in this thorough deconstruction of my past, so I can put that other thing to bed before it spirals out of con

Neal McBeal: [on TV] I had dibs! My dibs were on those muffins!

BoJack: Your dibs were void!

Neal McBeal: I spent a year in Afghanistan making America safer, and this is the thanks I get?

BoJack: Really, you, specifically, made America safer?

Tom Jumbo-Grumbo: Well, BoJack, surely, even you would agree that the troops are heroes.

BoJack: I don't agree to that. Maybe some of the troops are heroes but not automatically. I'm sure a lot of the troops are jerks. Most people are jerks already, and it's not like giving a jerk a gun and telling him it's okay to kill people suddenly turns that jerk into a hero. [Beat] What?

[PAUSE]

Tom Jumbo-Grumbo: Did you just say you think the troops are jerks?

BoJack: Oh, you took that the bad way, didn't you?

BoJack: [on TV] "I'm sure a lot of the troops are jerks." No, no, no.

Tom Jumbo-Grumbo: The troops are jerks?

BoJack: Oh, God. [on TV] "Most people are jerks already, and it's not like giving a jerk a gun—"

BoJack: Hello?

Laura: Princess Carolyn needs to talk to you immediately.

BoJack: Great, put her on.

Laura: She's actually just getting out of a meeting. Can you hold for a sec?

BoJack: You called me.

    "When you're walking alone" 
    "Because Jellicles are And Jellicles do Je" 

BoJack: Ugh.

    ["LIKE AN HOUR LATER"] 

    "Jellicles would And Jellicles can" 

Princess Carolyn: BoJack.

BoJack: Ah!

Princess Carolyn: I'm gonna level with you, honey. This whole you hating the troops thing is not great.

BoJack: I don't hate the troops. I just hate one specific troop. I don't even hate him, really. I just think that he's wrong about the muffins.

Princess Carolyn: I know, BoJack just like always, you're right, and everyone else is wrong. But if you don't swallow your pride, this is never gonna let up. I know you're stubborn—

BoJack: I'm not stubborn. I'm proud.

Princess Carolyn: That's kind of the same thing.

BoJack: No, it's an important distinction.

Princess Carolyn: Okay, fine. You're not stubborn. But I'm about to tell you something very important, so I want you to listen carefully. I'm getting another call. I'm gonna have to put you on hold.

    " When you're walking alone" 
    " Because Jellicles are" 
    " And Jellicles do; Je— " 

    LATER 

Tom Jumbo-Grumbo: It is now day three of the great "BoJack jerk-off"—Really? That's the name we came up with for this? Who came up with that? Was it Randy? Did Randy come up with that? Anyway, the former television actor who hates our troops has not left his home since his controversial remarks on Monday about how he hates the troops.

Bear: ["BoJack's views are unBEARable"] BoJack Horseman makes me sick. He voiced his opinion, even though it was unpopular, and that's the most cowardly thing a person can do.

[LIVE, "Some girl who slept with BoJack Horseman"]

Pam: After we made love, he covered himself in sheets—like an Arab.

Joan: (TV) At this very moment, Congress is voting on a major education bill that could completely restructure the—

Tom Jumbo-Grumbo: Joan, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but we've got some big news on the BoJack Horseman front. It appears that BoJack's Lexus is coming out of the garage. This is very big news, indeed.

Reporter: Any comment on BoJack's controversial remarks this week?

Todd: Uh, nope.

BoJack: So where are we going?

Todd: Don't worry, I've got a plan.

Diane: Whoa! Jeez.

Todd: Ayako, hey, I need you to get me three tickets to Kyoto.

Ayako:(speaks Japanese) "You son of a bitch! You told me you were an obscenely rich American entrepreneur. You had eighty dollars in your bank account."

Todd: Hey, I meant I was rich because I have friends like George Bailey.

Ayako:(speaks Japanese)"Eighty! Who the shit is George Bailey? Do you have any idea how much work went into scamming you? George Bailey!"

Todd: Hello? Well, I'm out of ideas.

Diane: We can hide out at my place while we make a plan.

BoJack: Yeah, great, just get me away from the cameras.

    Mr. Peanutbutter's house 

BoJack: Do we really need to be filming this?

Mr. Peanutbutter: It's for my reality show. You never know when gold's gonna strike.

BoJack: Yeah, gold doesn't strike.

Mr. Peanutbutter: That's why you never know.

Princess Carolyn: BoJack, be nice.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Just pretend they're not there.

BoJack: Okay. Well, I—

Boom Mic Man: Could you speak up, please?

BoJack: I'd like to—

Boom Mic Man: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That's too loud.

BoJack: I want to fix this as quickly as possible. I don't care who was right about the muffins anymore, even though I was definitely right. I just want my privacy back, so I can finish writing my tell-all memoir, so everyone will pay attention to me again.

Princess Carolyn: I've already reached out to the McBeal camp. He's willing to publicly forgive you if you publicly apologize and present to him a box of muffins as a symbol of your great admiration for the American military and everything they do.

BoJack: But I ate the muffins.

Princess Carolyn: I know. We got another box. It's in the cupboard.

BoJack: Oh, you were saving those? I ate those too.

Princess Carolyn: We've been here for ten minutes! It's okay, we'll get more muffins.

Todd: I'll get the muffins, and they're on me. I just found out I got 80 bucks in the bank. I'm helping! Hooray!

BoJack: So where are we gonna do this? Do I have to go on MSNBSea?

Princess Carolyn: No, we should do it somewhere people will actually see it.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Oh, why don't you do it on Peanutbutter and Jelly?

BoJack: You can't call a show Peanutbutter and Jelly -- if there's no jelly.

Mr. Peanutbutter: It's a pun.

BoJack: It's not a pun if it only works one way.

Princess Carolyn: Is this a necessary conversation to be having right now?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Look, I know tempers are high, but let's not take it out on the great title for my reality show, which we all agree is really clever. We can edit this to make me look smart, right?

    " Yeah " 
    " Peanutbutter " 
    " Come on " 

Mr. Peanutbutter: How's this look? Looks good? Okay.

Man: Marker, sound, speed.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Well, here I am, hanging out with my good friend -- BoJack Horseman, enjoying each other's company, as we often do.

BoJack: Yes, this is all very authentic and natural.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Oh, someone's at the door! I will see who it is. Wow, this is a surprise. Neal McBeal.

Neal McBeal: Hello, sir. Thank you for inviting me into your home. It is lovely.

Mr. Peanutbutter: BoJack, is there anything you'd like to give Neal McBeal?

Neal McBeal: Ahem.

BoJack: Oh, yeah, Todd? What the hell is this?

Todd: I tried to buy the muffins, but my bank card got declined for some reason. But don't worry, I still saved the day because I found this bag of stale hamburger buns.

BoJack: I'm sorry?

Todd: Yeah, they're just giving them away behind In-'N'-Out. Why does anybody pay for anything? Ow!

BoJack: Uh, Neal, as a token of my admiration, please accept this—bag of stale hamburger buns.

Neal McBeal: What?

BoJack: Yes, hamburger buns. It's a—symbol for how we throw our veterans in the trash, sadly, far too often.

Neal McBeal: I'm listening.

BoJack: We send our muffins overseas, and they come back as stale hamburger buns, but that doesn't mean we should love them any less, because in their own way, aren't stale hamburger buns just as good? Mmm. American made.

Neal McBeal: So what you're saying is, you think I'm a hero.

BoJack: Well, I don't know if I—

Neal McBeal: Say it, BoJack. Say I'm a hero.

BoJack: You're a hero. The troops are all heroes, every single one.

Neal McBeal: Great.

BoJack: And I don't believe saying that cheapens the word and actually disrespects those we mean to honor by turning real people into political pawns.

Neal McBeal: Okay, you can let go of the bag now.

BoJack: Also, I am not deeply ambivalent about a seemingly mandated celebration of our military by a nation that claims to value peace telling our children that violence is never the answer while refusing to hold our own government to the same standard.

Neal McBeal: Yeah, me neither. I think we're in agreement here.

BoJack: Furthermore, I do not find it unbelievably appropriate that this conversation is taking place on reality television, a genre which thrives on chopping the complexities of our era into easily digestible chunks of empty catchphrases.

Neal McBeal: Okay.

BoJack: And finally, I don't—

Man: Hey, look, Mr.Peanutbutter got a bucket stuck on his head.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Guys, guys, where am I? Can someone tell me where I am?

Neal McBeal: Hey, where'd he get that bucket from? Who gave him a bucket? Ha-ha-ha

BoJack: Uh, actually, I had another point I wanted to make.

Todd: Yeah, but who doesn't love a dog with a bucket on his head? Come on. Bucket! Bucket! Bucket!

All: Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Bucket!

Mr. Peanutbutter: Hey, can anyone find a handle? Oh, thank you, my friend. You're a real hero.

BoJack: Unbelievable.

Mr. Peanutbutter: What's your name, young lady?

Angela: Well, my real name's Angela, but my friends call me "Jelly."

Mr. Peanutbutter: What?! Oh, my God, did we get that? Please tell me we got that.

BoJack: You want a day-old hamburger bun?

Diane: I'm all right. How'd it go down there?

BoJack: You know what the problem is with everybody? They all just want to hear what they already believe. No one ever wants to hear the truth.

Diane: I want to hear the truth. I don't know if you want to tell it, though.

BoJack: What do you mean?

Diane: Mr. Normal Childhood, Mr. Uneventful Father? Look, I can write you the standard empty-calorie celebrity tell-some if that's what you're looking for, but I thought you might want more than that.

BoJack: I do.

Diane: Well, then you're going to have to open up and give me something real.

BoJack: What, you think I can't open up?

Diane: Well, I don't know if you can or not. You certainly haven't.

BoJack: [sighs] Okay, from now on, full truth, warts, and all. You're not gonna make me look like an asshole, are you?

Diane: I don't know, are you an asshole?

BoJack: Okay, full truth, here we go. You want to know about my parents? They drank, a lot. My father was a failed novelist. My mother was the heiress to the Sugarman Sugar Cubes fortune, and my dad resented her for it. He used to make me cry with him while listening to Cole Porter records. He made me build my own treehouse, and then he tore it down while I was at summer camp because instead of hearty, Christian nails, I used screws, which he called: "fancy Jew nails." Like I said, totally normal. 

The Horse: Who wants chocolate chip pancakes?

Ethan: I do! I do!

Olivia: Ethan, didn't you already eat your pancakes?

Ethan: As Oliver North would say, "I do not recall."

[laughter]

The Horse: Hey, where's Sabrina?

Sabrina: Not hiding under the table, that's for sure.

Audience: Aww

The Horse: Why don't you guys leave this one to me? Why aren't you dressed for school, prickly-muffin?

Sabrina: I'm scared. Olivia told me sometimes, at school they have pop quizzes. I don't want to pop! That's too much, man!

The Horse: Sabrina, nobody's popping on my watch. You stick with me, and I promise you, everything's gonna be just fine.

Man: Cut, boom in the shot.

BoJack: What? I'll be in my trailer. Nah, I'm just horsin' around. You folks enjoying the show? And how about Sarah Lynn as Sabrina? Isn't she wonderful?

Sarah Lynn: Oh. Thank you.

BoJack: Sarah Lynn. You remember that name.

Man: Back to one, everybody.

BoJack: Hey, you see those people?

Sarah Lynn: Yeah.

BoJack: Well, those boobs and jerk wads are the best friends you'll ever have. Without them, you're nothing. Remember that.

Man: Let's take it back to "prickly-muffin."

BoJack: Your family will never understand you, your lovers will leave you or try to change you, but your fans, you be good to them, and they'll be good to you.

Man: We are rolling. Sound speed.

BoJack: The most important thing is, you got to give the people what they want, even if it kills you, even if it empties you out until there's nothing left to empty. No matter what happens, no matter how much it hurts, you don't stop dancing, and you don't stop smiling, and you give those people what they want.

Man: And action.

The Horse: Why aren't you dressed for school, prickly-muffin?

    "TWELVE YEARS LATER" 

A Ryan Seacrest Type: You might remember her as adorable Sabrina from Horsin' Around, but on her new dance-pop album, Sarah Lynn wants you to know that she is hot to trot.

Sarah Lynn: (sings) Why don't you touch my prickly muffin? My prickly muffin Ooh, prickly And it's muffin, and it's .. It's ready for your stuffing

A Ryan: What is the message behind your music?

Sarah Lynn: America needs to know that I'm not that little girl anymore. I'm a grown up, sophisticated woman now, and I have sex, and I do sexy things. People like sex, okay, and since I'm sexy right now, they like me.

A Ryan: Are you at all worried that audiences will grow bored and abandon you for the next sexy thing?

Sarah Lynn: Are you kidding? I'm Sarah freaking Lynn. I'm gonna be sexy forever!

    "ANOTHER TWELVE YEARS LATER" 

A Ryan Seacrest Type: Pop star and child actress, Sarah Lynn, celebrates her 30th birthday this month, raising the question, "does anyone care about Sarah Lynn anymore?" After all, she is 30. Here to answer that question, sexy, 14-year-old dubstep wunderkind, Sextina Aquafina.

Sextina Aquafina: Hey!

A Ryan: Sextina, what's your take?

Sextina: I love Sarah Lynn. I grew up on her music, okay, and she's, like, an inspiration, but now, she is old, and shriveled, and gross, and nobody want her no more, okay? They want Sextina Aquafina, baby!

A Ryan: Ha ha! You're delightful. So where does Sarah Lynn go from here?

Sextina: Oh, you know where she should go? She should go wherever famous people go when they're done being famous, and nobody cares if they live or die.

BoJack: Who could that be?

    THEME MUSIC 

    "Five Hours earlier" 

Todd: Who-o-o wants chocolate chip pancakes? I do! I do!

BoJack: Why are you talking to me?

Todd: I thought maybe if I said that, you'd make me chocolate chip pancakes.

BoJack: [groans]

Todd: Oh, come on, buddy. It's a beautiful morning, the sun is shining, birds are chirping

Blue Jay: Hey, BoJack, any plans for the weekend?

Robin: Still hate the troops, Boj?

Blue Jay: Why don't you refill your bird feeder, huh?

Robin: Yeah, who's a bird got to blow to get some seed around here?

Blue Jay: Good one.

Todd: Let's do something fun today.

BoJack: Like what?

Todd: Like a cannonball! Like a "buying you a new bed?"

    CUT 

"The Swine Within Reach" "modern furniture"

Todd: Wow, everything in this store is made out of old train tracks and a reclaimed pier.

BoJack: Oh, great, for ten grand, I can sleep like a hobo.

Todd: Do we need letter openers made out of Confederate bayonets? It says they're stained with authentic Yankee blood.

Fan Girl One: O-M-G. O-M-G! O-M-M-F-C-S-D-V-R-Q-Q-P-Q-F-G!

Fan Girl Two: I know.

BoJack: Ugh. Yeah, it's me, straight off your TV screens and into your shitty lives.

Fan Girl One: It's Sarah Lynn and Andrew Garfield!

BoJack: Huh? What the?

Andrew Garfield: And what's your name, darling?

Fan Girl Two: I—mm

Andrew Garfield: I'll just make it out to "Evelyn." Uh

BoJack: Um, hi. Sarah Lynn, hi.

Sarah Lynn: BoJack? Hey. Andrew, this is BoJack, my TV dad.

Andrew Garfield: Oh, hello, I'm Andrew Garfield.

Sarah Lynn: Andrew's my boyfriend. We're a celebrity power couple. It's no big deal. (whispers to BoJack) It's a really big deal.

Andrew Garfield: Sarah Lynn, I actually wanted to talk to you about that. When we started dating, you were the biggest star in the world, but your last few albums tanked, so now, I don't even know what you are anymore.

Sarah Lynn: Are you.. Are you breaking up with me?

Andrew Garfield: Oh, bother.

BoJack: Um, are those candy pills, 'cause if so, that is a lot of sugar.

Sarah Lynn: Why are you doing this to me?! Do you like seeing me suffer? Because you know I'll bleed for you.

Sarah Lynn: Oh!

Todd: Damn!

Andrew Garfield: Oh, dear.

BoJack: Whoa-oh-oh. Um

Andrew Garfield: Darling, please, I wanted to do this in a public place so you wouldn't make a scene.

Sarah Lynn: You think I won't make a scene, you limey bastard? Then you really don't know me at all. Hey, everyone! Who wants to see me take a dump on that sofa?

Todd: (raises a hand)

    NOW 

BoJack: And then she took a dump on a sofa made out of a reclaimed propeller.

Diane: Where's Sarah Lynn now?

BoJack: I checked her into Promises. 28 days, she'll be good as new.

Diane: How did it feel to check the girl you raised on television into rehab?

BoJack: It was tough. I would have liked to reconnect with her. At least we got to bond a little on the drive to Malibu.

    PAST 

Sarah Lynn: I can see my organs.

Todd: Oh, whoa! She is losing a lot of blood, BoJack.

BoJack: Beautiful day for a drive, though, huh?

    NOW 

Diane: Well, maybe the two of you can catch up some more when she gets out of rehab.

BoJack: People don't usually want to hang out with me after rehab. I'm really more of a before-rehab friend. I think it's gonna be a long time before I see Sarah Lynn again. (door bells) Who could that be?

Sarah Lynn: Look, BoJack, I appreciate what you were trying to do, but I don't need rehab. Look, good as new, huh?

BoJack: Oh, great, well, that's a relief. Uh, should you be taking all those pills?

Sarah Lynn: It's dexitriathylphenolbarbatol. I got it from a doctor.

BoJack: Your doctor or just A doctor?

Sarah Lynn: I don't know, some doctor, okay? I met him at Adam Levine's Halloween party. I think he said his name was Dr. Who.

BoJack: Yeah, I don't think that was

Sarah Lynn: Ohh, God damn.

BoJack: Uh, are you supposed to be snorting it like that?

Sarah Lynn: Ugh! What are you, the paramedic who restarted my heart at Adam Levine's Halloween party?

BoJack: Okay, so before we put to bed the whole you going to rehab thing -

Sarah Lynn: BoJack, all my life, I've never been forced to confront my problems head on. No one has ever said "no" to me, ever, so is it cool if instead of confronting my problems head on, I just hide out here for a little bit?

BoJack: Sarah Lynn, I hear what you're saying, and I think I know what you need. You just need a strong, responsible adult to say: "Yes. Yes, you can move in with me." This is gonna be fun. Hey, everyone, the old gang's getting back together. Three little orphans—One, two, three

    LATER 

BoJack: Who-o-o wants chocolate chip pancakes?

Sarah Lynn: I do! I do!

Todd: Uh, what's going on in here?

BoJack: Morning, sleepy-pooh, you want pancakes?

Todd: Yeah, that sounds great.

BoJack: Ooh, tough break, champ. I just gave the last one to Sarah Lynn. Early bird gets the worm.

Sarah Lynn: More like early turd gets the sperm.

BoJack: Wha? "Early turd gets the sperm," nice one, Sarah Lynn. You should do a Shouts and Murmurs. Help yourself to some cold wheat bran, sport.

Todd: Ugh.

Sarah Lynn: Thanks for letting me crash here, BoJack.

BoJack: The guest room is yours as long as you want.

Todd: You have a guest room? Why have I been sleeping on the couch for five years?

BoJack: You'll get the guest room when you've earned the guest room.

Sarah Lynn: These pancakes are so good. All Andrew ever wanted to eat was stupid lasagna.

Todd: Andrew Garfield loves lasagna?

Sarah Lynn: I don't want to talk about him! BoJack, can you drive me to the mall today? I really want to go shopping, but I'm not allowed to drive because somebody got a DUI.

Todd: Uh, that somebody was you, right?

Sarah Lynn: I don't have to answer your questions! What are you, the cop that pulled me over after Adam Levine's Halloween party?

BoJack: Honey, do you really think going to the mall's a good idea? I seem to recall another time you went shopping when things got pretty out of control.

Sabrina: Oh, that's too much, man!

Todd: Really? Not the time when she gored herself with a bayonet and shat on a floor model?

Sarah Lynn: Hey, I'm not the crazy one. Andrew's the one who flies off the handle whenever his agent sets up an audition on a Monday.

Todd: Andrew Garfield hates Mondays and loves lasagna?

Sarah Lynn: I said I don't want to talk about it!

BoJack: She said drop it, Todd!

Sarah Lynn: Whatever, I don't want to go to the stupid mall. I'll just tell my friends to come here.

BoJack: Muffin, I've got to work on my book today, and I can't have a bunch of folks over making a lot of noise.

Sarah Lynn: Oh, I see. I'm a burden to you.

BoJack: No, no, no, no, no. Sweetheart. Sweetheart.

Sarah Lynn: I'm no longer cute, so I have nothing to offer this world.

BoJack: Honey, of course your friends are always welcome here.

Sarah Lynn: Cool. Bye.

Todd: Can I invite a frien..

BoJack: No.

Princess Carolyn: (at VIGOR) You let that basket case into your house? That girl is a PR hurricanethat you don't need right now.

BoJack: She has nowhere else to turn. She broke up with her boyfriend. She stabbed herself and closed the wound with duct tape. She fired her agent..

Princess Carolyn: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Back it up, horsey. Did you say Sarah Lynn doesn't have an agent? Laura, hold my calls, cancel everything! Ahab's got a white whale to catch, baby!

BoJack: Uh, hello? Still there?

Todd: Oh, th..that's..that's fragile. Uh, no, oh, no, wait. Careful. Careful. Careful. Whoa! Hey, hey, hey! Ah! Lemur!

Lemur: Great party, Sarah Lynn.

Princess Carolyn: Hi, what it is, banana bread?

Sarah Lynn: I'm not looking for a new agent right now.

Princess Carolyn: Oh, whoa, whoa. Who says I'm looking for a new client? Slow your roll, Speed Racer. We're just two single ladies having a no-presh rap sesh. I'm not one of those agents who can't turn it off. Your Ari Emanuels and Vanessa Gekkos and what have you.

Sarah Lynn: Vanessa Gekko is actually Andrew's agent, and she's really great.

Princess Carolyn: Is she? I've heard that.

Diane: I didn't realize you were so into house music.

BoJack: Look, I asked her to turn it down, but apparently, this volume was prescribed by Dr.Who to treat something called "uptight dickhead disease." What do you.. What do you think about Sarah Lynn?

Diane: Oh, I don't really think about her all that much. I mean, obviously, I'm a fan of her early work which both satirized and celebrated youth culture's obsession with sex, but I do wonder as a third-wave feminist if it's even possible for women to reclaim their sexuality in this deeply entrenched patriarchal society, or if claiming to do so is just a lie we tell ourselves so we can more comfortably cater to the male gaze.

BoJack: Uh, what?

Diane: But you know, on the other hand, I worry that conversations like this one often dismiss her as a mere puppet of the industry ..

BoJack: That's my same worry.

Diane: —incapable of engaging in these discussions herself..

BoJack: Obviously.

Diane: —and infantilization, which is itself a product of the deeply misogynistic—

BoJack: So deep.

Diane: .. society we live in. But like I said, I don't really think about her all that much.

BoJack: Okay, well, that is very interesting, but I was more asking, like,what do you think about her living here?

Diane: Oh, right. Well, what was your relationship like with her when you were working on the show?

BoJack: It was very good, very professional.

    PAST 

Sarah Lynn: BoJack, where did you go to college?

Mother: Don't bother him, honey.

BoJack: Oh, it's no problem.

Mother: Honey, college is for ugly people who can't tap dance.

Sarah Lynn: I want to be an architect.

Mother: Sweetheart, Mommy didn't do what Mommy did to that Star Search producer so that you could be an architect.

Sarah Lynn: Aw.

BoJack: All right, take it sleazy, everybody.

Sarah Lynn: Wait, BoJack, um, what are you doing this weekend?

BoJack: I don't know. I'll probably just go to the amusement park, maybe the circus, fly a kite on the beach, watch the sunset, then I'll head back to my place to watch any number of Disney princess movies while eating ice cream straight from the tub.

Sarah Lynn: Whoa, that sounds like so much fun. Can I come?

BoJack: Yeah, like I want to spend my weekend hanging out with a little girl. Good one! You should write for the Shouts and Murmurs. See you Monday!

    NOW 

Diane: So the makeup they were putting on you was not for the show, it was just for the weekend?

BoJack: Why does that matter?

Diane: I'm just trying to understand the story. Do you think it's possible that you inviting Sarah Lynn into your house now is your way of compensating for not..

BoJack: No, Diane, I'm just helping out a friend. I'm not trying to play out some weird, sick dad fantasy, or resolve a deep guilt for past neglect, or even try to retroactively fix my own childhood by recreating someone else's, and I'm especially not doing all those things at once!

Diane: Okay.

[the sound of crash]

BoJack: What happened? Did somebody hurt my precious baby? Sarah Lynn! Ah! What the?

Sarah Lynn: Oh, hey, BoJack. I told my friends they could tear this wall out to build a sweet cocaine booth/sex closet. Is that cool?

BoJack: No, that's not cool.

Princess Carolyn: Oof. Way to harsh the vibe, Kissinger.

Sarah Lynn: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize. I thought this was a place where Sarah Lynn could finally be Sarah Lynn, but I guess -- that's too much, man.

BoJack: I always loved that catch phrase. Can your friends at least take the artwork off the wall first?

Sarah Lynn: Ooh. I want to say yes, but no.

BoJack: Okay, good talk.

Todd: Wha-a.. Are you serious?

Todd: The reason I have called this house meeting is because—

BoJack: Todd, how many times have we been over this? You don't have the authority to call house meetings. Only I can call a house meeting. You can propose a house meeting.

Todd: All right, fine, fine, fine, but the reason I propose—this house meeting

BoJack: Your proposal has been submitted and is under board review. Proposal denied.

Todd: BoJack, this Sarah Lynn thing is getting out of control, okay? She's taking advantage of you.

BoJack: What? No she's not. We have a special relationship. You couldn't possibly understand.

Todd: Oh, my God. Look at what she's done to your house. All right, look, I mean, I stepped on a needle earlier. I think I'm addicted to heroin now, so now, that's probably gonna be a whole thing.

Diane: I have to say, I agree with Todd. You're not this girl's father, and you're not doing her any favors by refusing to set boundaries.

BoJack: Look, I played a dad for nine years on TV, so I think I know a little bit more about parenting than you two jokers. The kids on Horsin' Around didn't need boundaries. All they needed was some good, old-fashioned love.

Todd: BoJack! This is not a TV show, okay? This is real life.

Lemur: Ah! Lemur on fire! Lemur on fire!

BoJack: Some good, old-fashioned love, and I'm gonna give it to her. I'm gonna give it to her so .. hard.

Todd: You know, I feel like we don't ever hang out.

Princess Carolyn: Here you are, milady, a gin and nutmeg just like you asked.

Sarah Lynn: Ugh. Too much nutmeg.

Princess Carolyn: Well, you know what would taste even better? An endorsement for a Slovakian yogurt. Could Vanessa Gecko get you that?

Sarah Lynn: Vanessa Gecko got Andrew The Social Network, and she has sky box seats at the Staples Center. What do you have?

Princess Carolyn: Well, I've got a table at the Comedy Central roast of Gloria Stein—

BoJack: Hey, Sarah Lynn, what say we spend the day together, just you and me, away from all the haters?

Sarah Lynn: I want to say yes, but—

BoJack: Great, let's go.

    It really seems like 
    Some things are forever in this world 
    Don't you know I'm feeling fine together with my girl 
    Daddy's girl 
    She's daddy's girl 

BoJack: You know, Sarah Lynn, I got a feeling everything's gonna be okay.

Sarah Lynn: Uh-huh. Hey, did you hear Kazaz got cancer?

BoJack: What? Herb Kazaz has cancer?

Sarah Lynn: Yeah, in the butt. He's got, like, six months I think.

BoJack: Well, that's horrible. Why would you tell me that now?

Sarah Lynn: I dunno. The sun setting over those two hills made me think of a big ass, and that made me think of ass cancer, and that made me think of Herb Kazaz's ass cancer. You really didn't know?

BoJack: No, Herb and I aren't on the best.. Look, I'm trying to have a moment here. I can't.. Hey, I want to give you something.

Sarah Lynn: Is this your TV Guide award?

BoJack: It's the most prestigious award I ever won. I always thought if I ever had kids of my own, I'd give it to them one day. I want you to have it.

Sarah Lynn: Oh, wow. BoJack, thanks. You're sweet.

BoJack: (sighs) [pretending TV Show credits are rolling] Na-na-na-na La-la-la-la—Na-na-na-na La-la-la-la

Sarah Lynn: What are you doing?

BoJack: Shh. Just let the credits roll, let the credits roll. Sha-na-na-na-na-na—Special moment—Exec Producer Garry Marshall Na-na-na Such a happy day. "Sit, Ubu, sit." Good dog. Arf."

Sarah Lynn: Can we go home now?

BoJack: Yeah, okay, we're done.

[Sextina Aquafina rapping]

    "Hey now, boy, come and try" 
    "My clitoris is ginormous" 

BoJack: Hello?

Mr. Peanutbutter: BoJack Horseman. Did you get rid of your old TV Guide award? This pawnshop on La Cienega was selling one with your name on it.

BoJack: What? Wait, why were you at a pawnshop?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Oh, I just have a guy there who calls me whenever TV awards come in so I can buy 'em. I put my name on, it's like I won it myself! I have two Golden Globes and a People's Choice forTemple Grandin.

BoJack: Sarah Lynn!

Mr. Peanutbutter: Hello? You still there?

[Sextina]

    "My clitoris is ginormous baby—" [record scratch] 

BoJack: Okay, party's over. Everybody out.

Sarah Lynn: Aw!

BoJack: Not you. You are in big trouble, young lady. I can't believe you pawned my award.

Sarah Lynn: It wasn't personal. I just thought your award was stupid—and I already have a billion other awards, and I wanted to get money for drugs.

BoJack: Look, things have been tough for you, and I understand that. I know what you're going through right now.

Sarah Lynn: Oh, you know what I'm going through? Why? Because you were on some dumb kids show a million years ago?

BoJack: Hey, now.

Sarah Lynn: I had my own fashion line when I was ten. By twenty, I was packing stadiums. I get letters every day from boys telling me that I was the first girl they masturbated to. Literally, someone tells me that every day.

BoJack: That is gross.

Sarah Lynn: Oh-ho, I know! You sit up here in your little house and feel sorry for yourself? Oh, guess what, Bo-J, in order to be a has-been, you have to have actually, you know, been.

BoJack: You are way out of line!

Sarah Lynn: You're not my dad. You're just a rugged, older man who provided me with a strong, masculine presence during my formative years.

BoJack: I'm not your dad, and you're not my child. We're just a man and a lady living in a house together, and we're both adults, and we're both a little drunk.

    LATER 

[BoJack: ] Who-o-o lit my ottoman on fire?

Todd: Seriously, you seriously don't know?

Sarah Lynn: I'm a bad "widdle" girl.

BoJack: Yeah, you are bad, very bad!

Sarah Lynn: You want me to put it out with my boob?

Todd: Uh, what?

BoJack: Your boob is a very—impractical way to put out a fire.

Todd: What is happening?

BoJack: I think you have a serious drug problem.

Sarah Lynn: The only drug I need is horse.

Todd: Guys, guys, what are you doing? Please don't do this. No, no. Why are you—This is a very bad idea. Can I at least get my blanket.. let me get my blanket out from under—Oh G Oh, my God, my arm. You got my arm. Ow! Ow! I'm in it now. Oh, God, no! I'm a part of it.

    LATER 

Todd: I still haven't regained the feeling in my fingers. That was the longest two minutes of my life.

BoJack: Um, I think it was a little longer than two minutes. It was longer than two minutes.

Todd: How do you not get that this is terrible?

BoJack: Oh, you mean from a P.R. standpoint? Yeah, 'cause if this got out, oh, I would get flayed!

Todd: Oh, I'm done being the voice of reason. It's exhausting. I got to take an angry nap. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.

BoJack: I know. I know. She's taking advantage of me.

Diane: Actually, it kind of feels like you're the one taking advantage of her. She's the one with substance abuse problems and daddy issues.

BoJack: Hey, we both have substance abuse problems and daddy issues.

Diane: Yeah, but she came to you for help.

Princess Carolyn: Hey, notice how I've been ignoring you, playing hard to get? Only makes you want me more.

Sarah Lynn: Ugh. Go stand on the other side of the room.

Princess Carolyn: Okay.

BoJack: Sarah Lynn, get your coat. I'm taking you to rehab.

Sarah Lynn: Nah, I was gonna keep hanging out here if that's all right.

BoJack: No, it's not all right.

Sarah Lynn: What?

BoJack: This place isn't good for you. You need to go where you can get help, real help.

Sarah Lynn: But I thought you were always gonna be there for me like you said.

The Horse: I will always be there for you.

Man: Cut, let's take ten. That's ten, everyone. Let's make it a tight ten.

BoJack: [smokes] These pages are shit. You understand? Shit. I wouldn't wipe my ass with these pages. It would defeat the whole purpose of wiping my ass.

Man: Phone for you.

BoJack: Uh-huh. You get me points on the back end? Well, I told you I'm not gonna do it unless I get points. Oh, they can't find any? Well, maybe they could suck some out of my dick!

Sarah Lynn: [coughs]

BoJack: I'm on the phone. You're being very rude.

    NOW 

Sarah Lynn: You promised me you would always be there.

BoJack: Sarah Lynn, this is for your own good. You can't stay here anymore.

Sarah Lynn: Okie-doke. I guess I'll just move out and find one of the billion people who will let me party at their house.

BoJack: Uh, well, you should not do that.

Sarah Lynn: Oh, I know. I know, but I can, so I will. I'm at a place right nowwhere I never need to grow as a person or rise to an occasion because I can constantly just surround myself with sycophants and enablers until I die tragically young.

BoJack: Wh—What?

Sarah Lynn: Yeah, it's pretty much too late for me. Well, them's the breaks. Take it sleazy, everybody. [to Princess Carolyn] Oh, by the way, I called Vanessa Gekko, and I'm meeting with her tomorrow. Thanks for the suggestion.

Princess Carolyn: No! No, no, no, no, no!

Sarah Lynn: Hey, you guys want to hear my new catchphrase? Suck a dick, dumb shits!

Princess Carolyn: Laura, the dummy took the bait. Now for phase two.

Todd: Is she gone? Is it safe to come out?

Princess Carolyn: Leak to the trades that Andrew Garfield's agent is taking meetings with his ex, get it all over town, wait an hour, then get me lunch with Andrew on the books for this weekend, someplace Italian.

BoJack: I really blew it, didn't I?

Diane: I mean, maybe you could have been a better role model when she was young, but also, she never really had a chance. This is what our celebrity culture does to people.

BoJack: So what you're saying is: Everything is society's fault, and we as individuals never need to take responsibility for anything?

Diane: Uh, no. Not exactly. I was just saying that..

BoJack: Yeah. I like that. I didn't do anything wrong because I can't do anything wrong because we're all just products of our environment, bouncing around like marbles in the game of Hungry Hungry Hippos that is our random and cruel universe.

Diane: Wait, no, that's not even what I'm saying

BoJack: Yeah, It's not my fault. It's society. Everything is because of society!

Diane: BoJack, that—

Todd: Dude, just let him have this.

BoJack: Hooray! Everything is meaningless! Nothing I do has consequence!

Blue Jay: So what'd you get, anything good?

Robin: Oh, I got everything. 

BoJack: (performs) And he says.. he says, "Why the long face?" And I say, "Hey, buddy, I can't help it." You get that? Long face. Horses have long faces. I am a horse, my face is long. You get it, right? Good, good. What about the Rock Hudson stuff? Felt like that flew over your heads. Did you get that?

Herb Kazazz: (heckles) Keep this up, and the only thing we're gonna get is our money back!

BoJack: Okay, okay, it wasn't that funny.

Herb: Maybe you didn't get it.

BoJack: Uh, hey, guys, guys—it'd—

    LATER, at a Bar 

Herb: Hey, let me buy you a drink.

BoJack: Get cancer, jerkwad.

Herb: You've got some good material, you really do. The Gorbachev stuff, it's killer. But you gotta stop asking people if they get things.

BoJack: But then how do I know if they got it?

Herb: They'll laugh.

BoJack: Why are you giving me advice?

Herb: Look, I've been doing stand-up for a year now, and it's the responsibility of big shots like me to always be looking out for the little guy. Let me buy you a drink.

BoJack: Oh, I don't drink. BoJack Horseman.

Herb: Herb Kazazz.

    NOW 

BoJack: Oh, God! Goddamn it, Todd, clean up your shit.

Todd: What am I supposed to do, okay? You don't give me any closet space.

BoJack: Not my problem. A better man than you once said, and I quote, "It's the responsibility of little guys like you to be looking out for big shots like me."

Todd: Who said that?

BoJack: I don't know, Jesus, Gandhi, Malcolm-Jamal Warner. Clean up your shit! Oh!

    "A Roast of Gloria Steinem" 

Roaster: Gloria Steinem, one of the leading lights of modern feminism. You will surely go down in the annals of history just as surely as Lisa Lampanelli will go down in the locker room of the Houston Rockets.

[laughter]

Mr. Peanutbutter: Hey, BoJack, settle a bet. Are you a Zoë or a Zelda?

BoJack: Don't know what that means.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Well, I was talking to Wayne.

BoJack: Who's Wayne?

Wayne: I'm Wayne.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Wayne's writing an article about me for BuzzFeed.

BoJack: BuzzFeed? What'll they think of next?

Diane: Fun fact: Wayne is also my ex-boyfriend.

Wayne: Huh, you're funny.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Pretty cool, eh, BoJack? Diane's writing a book about you, Wayne's writing an article about me. We're the same!

BoJack: How could you think that that's the same? My book will be in libraries for hundreds of years. Your BuzzFeed article will be crammed between an animated GIF of a cat falling asleep and a list of fun facts about Legally Blonde.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Ha! Classic Zoë.

BoJack: I still don't know what that means.

Wayne: Well, are you familiar with Mr.Peanutbutter's House?

BoJack: Do you mean his sitcom that coincidentally had the exact same premise as my sitcom?

Wayne: Not the exact same. Mr.Peanutbutter's House featured a pair of twins, Zoë and Zelda. Zelda was the sunny, fun-loving extrovert.

[Flashback to Mr. Peanutbutter's House]

Zelda: Look at my pumpkin, Mr.Peanutbutter.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Pretty smile, Zelly-belly.

Audience: Aww

Wayne: Whereas Zoë was the smart, cynical introvert.

Zoe: My pumpkin's throwing up because Halloween encourages excessive consumption of refined sugar at a time when obesity rates are sky-high. Plus, Halloween costumes are a gateway to casual racism.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Why don't I keep the knife, Zo-bo?

    "Who's that dog? Mr.Peanutbutter Knick-knack, paddywhack Give a dog a bone" 

Wayne: Now, was the show's acting ham-fisted and the writing moronic?

Mr. Peanutbutter: N-n-no?

Wayne: Yes, but the Zoë/Zelda paradigm rang true. I believe everyone's either a Zoë or a Zelda. For example, Nixon was a Zoë and Kennedy, a Zelda. Al Gore, Zoë. George W.Bush, total Zelda. It's R2-D2 and C-3PO, Zooey and Emily Deschanel.

Todd: So Zooey's a Zoë?

Wayne: No, Zooey's a Zelda. Emily's the Zoë.

Todd: What a crazy world.

Mr. Peanutbutter: So which one are you, BoJack?

BoJack: I think I'm above this.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Said the Zoë.

Todd: Well, I think I'm a Zelda.

BoJack: Or maybe you're the third kind of person—whose only function is to drain the energy and life force from his host organism.

Diane: Come on, BoJack.

Todd: Nah, he's right. I'm pretty much worthless.

BoJack: See? You say something to someone enough times, and eventually, he internalizes it. The system works.

Todd: I don't have a job, I don't have any prospects. I probably won't ever finish the rock opera I'm working on.

BoJack: What? Since when are you working on a rock opera? Oh, no. Why'd I ask that?

Todd: Basically, it's Tommy by way of Cirque du Soleil set in space, with heavy erotic overtones, and the gripping psychodrama of a thriller with plenty of heart and more than a little humor. I call it Newtopia Rising, Book 1: The Search for a New Utopia.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Book 1? You've got me thinking sequel here.

Todd: Traveling on a spaceship

Mr. Peanutbutter: I'm in.

BoJack: I'm out.

Todd: (sings) So far away from home To find a new and better place A planet rich with loam

—

BoJack: Loam? "Rich with loam?"

Todd: Yeah, it's a kind of soil. These people are simple, agricultural types.

BoJack: On a spaceship?

    "One Rock Opera Later" 

Todd: (sings) We learned a lot And had some laughs But they couldn't make us slaves—No! No, they couldn't make us slaves—No! No, they could-n-n-n't—Make u-u-u-us

Voice: One, two

BoJack: "Slaves." Just say "slaves."

Todd: Sla-a-a-a-a-a-aves!

BoJack: That was and I don't say this lightly worse than a hundred September 11ths.

Todd: Yeah, you're right. This was stupid. I don't know what I was thinking. Well, guess I'll give up forever.

BoJack: That's the spirit.

BoJack: Now, you have to understand that as a port city, Liverpool had unique access to all aspects of American culture, especially Blues music and its unruly nephew, Rock and Roll.

Diane: I thought this story was about running into Paul McCartney in the bathroom at the Golden Globes.

BoJack: It is. I thought you would appreciate some context.

Diane: Let's skip that one for a minute. Tell me about Todd.

BoJack: Todd? What's to tell? Five years ago, he found his way into one of my house parties and never left.

Diane: And you've never asked him anything about himself?

BoJack: I've asked him to get a job, I've asked him to move out.

Diane: With a little encouragement, I'll bet he could really flourish. I mean, didn't you have anyone who helped you when you were just starting out?

BoJack: Um, actually, no.

Diane: Todd clearly thinks the world of you.

BoJack: Todd thinks the world of Pop-Tarts.

Diane: Look, I get that helping other people is not your thing, but

BoJack: What? I let Todd live rent-free in my stately manse. I am his own personal Mother Teresa.

Diane: But do you let him stay here because you're kind or just because you're terrified of being alone?

BoJack: That is insane! I would love to be alone. That is all I want.

Diane: Mmm—if that were really true, I don't think you'd be clipping Todd's wings all the time.

BoJack: What? That's unbelievable. Todd!

Todd: What? Clean up my shit?

BoJack: Yes, but also, I would like to help you with your dumb-ass rock opera.

Todd: What?

BoJack: I am supporting you.

Todd: I- I don't understand. Oh, my God, are you dying?

BoJack: No. I think you have a great depth of untapped potential and I wish to mentor you in your art.

Todd: Really?

BoJack: Yes.

Todd: Wait, is this going to be like that time you promised to take me ice skating, and I got really excited about the ice skating, but then instead of ice skating, you left me at home so you could go to the strip club and then you took the strippers ice skating?

BoJack: No.

Todd: Then hooray!

BoJack: Let's dig in. Where to start? Okay, well, the headline is, I hate it. I hate everything about it. The premise is bad and the execution is also bad. It's an irredeemable jumble of shit.

Todd: Tough but fair.

Diane: Ahem.

BoJack: That said, I don't see why we can't make something really great here.

Todd: Okay, thank you. I'll work on that.

BoJack: Are you close?

Princess Carolyn: No!

BoJack: How 'bout now?

Princess Carolyn: No!

BoJack: Now?

Princess Carolyn: You're not even inside of me.

BoJack: Oh, Go-o-o-d! Did you get there?

Todd: Okay, so you know in the second act closer when the seekers of Newtopia are in the Turbidians' dungeon and they learn their ship has been destroyed?

BoJack: No.

Todd: Well, what if we move that to the fourth act?

BoJack: I have no idea what you're talking about, but that idea is terrible.

Todd: I hear the note. Let me see what I can do.

Todd: (sings) And that's why this planet su-u-u-u-u-cks—So?

BoJack: How can I put this? Imagine if the Holocaust happened every four years like the Olympics. I would rather that happened than your rock opera.

Todd: That's not really a note. In fact, none of your notes has been notes. I feel like you're not even listening.

BoJack: Yeah, well, you know what? Maybe I would listen if the Turbidians had some reason to enter the Cave of Swollen Dreams that didn't break the pact they made in act one with Queen Darneesa.

Todd: You have been listening.

BoJack: This just doesn't make sense. The Turbidians are a loyal people. They—they wouldn't betray their queen. Unless

BOTH: They were working for Queen Darneesa, who gave them a potion that would counteract the effects of the Elixir of Failed Remembrance so they could bring the secret knowledge from the cave back to her, and then establish Newtopia as a vassal state to the Craterman kingdom!

BoJack: Well, don't just sit there! Get this down!!

BoJack: Oh, you like that. You like daddy's good stuff?

Princess Carolyn: Not especially.

BoJack: Did you get there?

Todd: Okay, what if there isn't a robot army?

BoJack: I think you just blew this thing wide open.

Todd: (sings) We'll make this our Newtopia-a-a—

BoJack: "Up a fifth."

Todd: "A-a-ah—"

BoJack: "Down a fifth."

Todd: "A-a-ah—"

BoJack: That was great! This train is moving. Let's take a break and get lunch.

Todd: Wait, you want to get lunch with me?

BoJack: Yeah, that's right.

Todd: Is this like the time you invited me to lunch, but then, when I got to the restaurant, you texted me to tell me you weren't coming because you were at a strip club "eating stripper" for lunch, and also, it was my birthday?

BoJack: No.

Todd: Then hooray!

Mr. Peanutbutter: And that was the last time I worked with David O. Russell. What's that old expression? "Fool me once, shame on me, but fool me twice—fiddle-dee-dee."

Wayne: I do believe that is the expression.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Ooh, hold on. I gotta take this. Erica, I don't have time to be charmed to death right now.

Wayne: So how long have you been dating Mr.Peanutbutter? Is it serious? I'm only asking for the article.

Diane: Better question: How long does it take to write a BuzzFeed article?

Wayne: I want to be thorough.

Mr. Peanutbutter: What?! Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane! Do you know what today is?

Diane: Sunday?

Mr. Peanutbutter: It's "burritos as big as your head" day at El Taco Loco! We gotta go right now!

Diane: I thought we were going to see the Diane Arbus show at LACMA today. You know I love Diane Arbus.

Mr. Peanutbutter: I see what's happening here. Her name is Diane, and your name is Diane.

Diane: That's not what's happening.

Wayne: I can go to the Arbus show with you, Diane.

Mr. Peanutbutter: What?

Wayne: I've actually been meaning to go myself.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Oh, man, you guys are perfect for each other. Why did you ever break up?

Wayne: (nervously) Ha-ha-ha-—

Mr. Peanutbutter: Okay, less yakking, more snacking. Let's go ride in the car!

    "Silver Spoon Diner" 

Cow: Here's your steak.

Guy: Uh, sorry.

Cow: Mm-hmm.

BoJack: You mean to tell me that for a full year you were on the run from the Russian mafia?

Todd: Well, a Russian mafia.

BoJack: I can't believe you never told me any of this stuff. I just thought you were a dumb freeloader who ate all my food and played video games all day.

Todd: You should have seen me in high school. There was this one game, Decapathon.

BoJack: I remember that game. I was up for Dr.Decapitator in the movie version. They said they wanted someone hipper, but the part ended up going to Robert Downey.

Todd: Junior?

BoJack: If it was Junior, I would have said, "Junior."

Todd: That game basically destroyed my life.

Todd: (Narrates) I flunked out of school, my girlfriend left me. I mean, I didn't stop playing until my mom threw me out of the house. I mean, that's when I first realized, you know, I'm a total screw-up.

BoJack: You're not a screw-up anymore, Todd. You're about to have a hit rock opera on your hands.

Todd: I'm really glad you think that. I got Princess Carolyn to invite Virgil Van Cleef to our next rehearsal.

BoJack: Who in the what Van?

Todd: Virgil Van Cleef is the biggest name in rock opera. Okay, think of all the great rock operas from the last 20 years.

BoJack: Okay.

Todd: He had a piece of all of them.

BoJack: Wow, Todd, are you sure we're ready for that?

Todd: Hey, you said yourself the train is moving, but if you think we're not ready, I mean, I'll listen to you.

BoJack: Hey, you've done enough listening, buddy. Maybe it's about time I start listening.

Todd: Well, I feel like

BoJack: Gotta take this. Hello?

Blue Jay: Hello? BoJack Horseman? We have some very delicate pictures you might have an interest in not getting into the wrong hands.

BoJack: I am very happy with my current long-distance provider, thank you.

Robin: What?

BoJack: Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm having lunch with my friend.

Blue Jay: But if you just listen—

BoJack: All right gang, when Virgil Van Cleef gets here, look alive. This could be Todd's big break, so clap really hard and laugh at all the jokes, even if they're not funny, but also, be careful, because a lot of things you might think are jokes are not jokes, so, you know, look out.

Princess Carolyn: ha-ha-ha--

BoJack: That was not a joke.

Princess Carolyn: That was not a real laugh.

Mr. Peanutbutter: I hope you don't mind I brought Wayne along.

BoJack: Who's Wayne?

Wayne: I'm Wayne.

Mr. Peanutbutter: I just wanted to make sure he had everything he needs for the big BuzzFeed cover story.

BoJack: BuzzFeed is a website. There is no cover.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Eh, "tomato," "tomato."

BoJack: It's "tomato," "to-mah-to."

Mr. Peanutbutter: You say, "tomato," "to-mah-to," I say, "tomato," "tomato."

BoJack: Oh

Mr. Peanutbutter: Oh, hey, Diane, I got you something.

Diane: Oh, plane tickets?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Yep, to San Francisco. That's where the Arbus exhibit is heading next.

Diane: Oh, my God. Thanks, Mr.Peanutbutter.

Virgil Van Cleef: Gentlemen, dazzle me.

BoJack: What you're about to see is rough, very rough. It's a vomit pass at what might become a rock opera. Right now, it's set mostly in space, but we're not married to that. Todd is neither a singer nor a trained musician. In fact, he never even graduated high school, he told me in confidence. Keep all that in mind as you give it up for Todd.

ALL: Wahey! Whoo!

Todd: Okay, so we start in 1887 with a young Emma Goldman.

    FIVE HOURS LATER 

Todd: (sings) No they couldn-n-n-n't make u-u-u-us sla-a-a-a-a-aves.

Virgil Van Cleef: It needs a third act showstopper.

BoJack: I had the same note.

Virgil Van Cleef: But in all, it's spellbinding.

BoJack: All right!

Diane: Whoo!

Virgil Van Cleef: You know, I run a small theater in North Hollywood. We were supposed to mount a J.C.Superstar revival next month, but of course, Andrew Lloyd Webber has to be a real hot penis about everything. Oh, Andy. Fool me once, shame on you, but teach a man to fool me, and I'll be fooled for the rest of my life. Anyway, could this show be ready to debut in six weeks?

Todd: Six weeks? Uh, damn. Yeah, I guess so.

Virgil Van Cleef: Marvelous! We'll schedule an investor showcase posthaste. In the meantime, libations!

Todd: Ah!

Virgil Van Cleef: Popping, what?

Mr. Peanutbutter: This is great.

Diane: You know, just when you think you have a person pegged, he can still find ways to surprise you.

BoJack: Yeah, Todd really rose to the occasion, didn't he?

Diane: I was talking about you.

BoJack: Ah, well, it was nothing.

Diane: Maybe the Zoë has a little Zelda in him after all.

BoJack: I appreciate the sentiment, but I still think that game is stupid.

Todd: Hey, BoJack, do you realize what this means? I mean, if this thing's a hit, I could finally move out.

BoJack: Oh, uh, you're gonna move out?

Todd: You won't have to yell, "Hey, Todd, clean up your shit!" Or, "Todd, why haven't you cleaned up your shit yet?" Or, "Todd, what was the name of that guy from Perfect Strangers? Not Bronson Pinchot, but the other one?"

BoJack: Good, that's great. That's great and good. So good, so great. Just great, and also good.

Todd: Mm-hmm.

Virgil Van Cleef: (to Todd) And as you can see, progress has been swift. For tomorrow's investor showcase, we'll have choreography and pyrotechnics for you.

BoJack: This is all just happening so fast. I don't—I don't think Todd is ready for this.

Princess Carolyn: Todd's not ready or you're not ready?

BoJack: Don't make this about me. I've seen what happens when baby birds get pushed out of the nest too soon.

BoJack: It's not your fault.

Bird-mother: I thought he was ready. He seemed ready.

BoJack: It's not, your, fault.

Princess Carolyn: You're right. In these heady times, what Todd needs is an agent. Ha! Ha!

Virgil Van Cleef: I just need you to deliver—

Princess Carolyn: Hoo! Ha!

Virgil Van Cleef: That third act showstopper—

Princess Carolyn: Ha!

Virgil Van Cleef: .. and then we'll be fully financed!

Princess Carolyn: Todd can do it! Todd can do anything! Can I get your autograph?

Todd: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Princess Carolyn: And another autograph, and initial here, here, here, and here.

Todd: Right here?

Princess Carolyn: And the last four digits of your social.

Todd: Okay. (to BH) So I think the big third act number Virgil wants might be a big anthem that--

BoJack: Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy, buddy, I'm not gonna let you start on this until we stock up on snacks and Red Bull.

Todd: I do get snacky. You think of everything.

    TWELVE 8 

Margo: 'Scuse me, young man. Can you hand me that Ronnie Milsap cassingle in the 10-cent bin?

Todd: Sure thing, lady. Oh, my God. Decapathon VII?! This just came out.

BoJack: Todd, put it down.

Todd: Is this really only a dime?

Seller: If it's in there, that's the price.

BoJack: Todd, this is no time for a relapse.

Todd: Look, okay, I'll buy it now, but I won't play it 'till after I've written the new song.

BoJack: Todd, this is a bad idea!

Todd: Whoa!

Seller: All sales are final.

Todd: Okay, let's see here. I wonder if it still smells the same.

BoJack: I assure you, it still smells like cheap plastic and child labor.

Todd: Okay, here we go. Song time. Or should I just play one game now, just to get the creative juices flowing?

BoJack: We both know that if you play that game tonight, you'll never leave this couch!

Todd: Ah, no, you're right, of course. Thank you.

BoJack: Good night.

    TEN SECONDS LATER 

Todd: Come on, Decapathon, come on. Oh, come on, Decapathon. Oh.

Rooster: Wake up! It's the morning!

BoJack: Damn it, Todd, the investor showcase is in half an hour. Did you work on the song?

Todd: Huh?

BoJack: Pull yourself together, man!

Todd: Ugh! Why did the water have to come out of your mouth?

    NOHO 

Virgil Van Cleef: Well, I'm awfully sorry to have wasted your time. I don't think our man is going to show.

BoJack: Wait!

Virgil Van Cleef: Good God, what's happened? He looks like he was up all night playing some sort of videographic game. He's in no condition to debut a song.

BoJack: Give the kid a chance, Van Cleef.

Todd: (sing) Loam, loam, loam And a uh, little room to, uh, roam And on this planet It's our home In space

Sponsor: Rock opera? More like "schlock flop-era."

Todd: Loam

Virgil Van Cleef: Enough! Clearly, Van Cleef has shown a rare lapse in taste and judgment. I apologize for wasting your time with this talentless imp.

BoJack: Hey, Van Cleef, Todd may not be ready for the high-flying world of rock opera or the larger world outside of my living room couch, but you know what? He's a good friend.

Virgil Van Cleef: I don't see how that's relevant.

BoJack: No, of course you don't. Maybe Todd's worse off today, but you're worse off in the long run, because you're gonna die alone and unloved, you pompous, affected asshole!

Virgil Van Cleef: Mon dieu! Never have I ever!

Todd: Hey, maybe don't burn the bridge. I could still beg for a second chance.

BoJack: Shut your mouth, Todd. And you shut yours, Van Cleef, or I will buck it shut. Suck a dick, dumb shits!

BoJack: Oh, that damn video game.

Todd: No, it's not the video game's fault. I blew it. For a second, I actually convinced myself I was more than just a worthless screw-up. Fool me once, fool me twice, fool me chicken soup with rice.

BoJack: I guess there's a reason they don't call it "the rock opera fun." They call it "the rock opera business."

Todd: Guess I won't be needing this piece of junk anymore.

BoJack: Hey, no. Hold on to that. Why don't you just put it in the living room closet?

Todd: Really?

BoJack: In fact, from now on, you can keep all your stuff in the living room closet.

Todd: Thanks, BoJack, for everything.

BoJack: This, I will get rid of.

Diane: What the..?

Wayne: Don't look at those! Those are private!

Diane: Are these the notes you've been taking on Mr.Peanutbutter? It's gibberish! Have you just been mashing keys this whole time?

Wayne: It's a.. it's a work in progress.

Diane: What's really going on here?

Wayne: Look, I've been following you two around for the last couple weeks, and I think it's pretty obvious to everyone that you shouldn't be with Mr.Peanutbutter. You should be with me.

Diane: No, I've dated you. Sure, you're smart and sophisticated and cool, but you're also mean. What's your article on Mr. Peanutbutter called?

Wayne: The working title is, "Nine Jokes From the '90s We Haven't Stopped Laughing at."

Diane: I knew it!

Wayne: Come on! Like you're not gonna tear BoJack apart in your book.

Diane: I'm not "tearing him apart." I'm writing a nuanced portrait of a complicated man.

Wayne: Well, then, we might be doing different things.

Diane: Mr.Peanutbutter is nice to me! He's kind and he's generous and he's loyal.

Wayne: You know what your problem is? You're trying to be a Zelda but you're so obviously a Zoë.

Diane: Don't label me. You don't know who I am.

Wayne: You can live your happy Zelda life in this happy Zelda town and pretend you're a happy Zelda, but I know you, and this isn't you.

Wayne: People don't change, Diane, not really. Mr.Peanutbutter's a Zelda. He's happy and he's carefree and he's loving, but you and me, we're Zoës.

    "BEAST BUY" 

BoJack: Yeah, I bought this earlier, and I'd like to return it. I don't know where the receipt went.

Henry: I remember you. You came in yesterday. No problem.

Wayne: We're Zoës, Diane. We're cynical and we're sad and we're mean.

BoJack: Thanks for your help, character actress Margo Martindale.

Margo: I don't feel good about what we did here, BoJack.

BoJack: I don't know what you're talking about. This never happened.

Wayne: There's a darkness inside you, and you can bury it deep in burritos as big as your head, but someday soon, that darkness is gonna come out, and when it does, I want you to call me.

Mr. Peanutbutter: I like that guy.

Todd: Ah-- 

Man: Come on!

BoJack: Oh, is it this guy? ("Thanks from ABC") Never travel without it.

Man: Stop holding up the line, idiot!

BoJack: It's not his fault. He's just doing his job.

Man: It's your fault, dummy.

TSA agent: I'm sorry, sir, no liquid over three ounces.

BoJack: This is Pappy Van Winkle, ol' friend. Do you know how old this bourbon is? If this was a person, I would've stopped having sex with it a year ago.

TSA agent: I'm sorry, sir.

BoJack: Do you know who I am?

ALL: Come on. Dude—

BoJack: I'm actually a huge celebrity on my way to New York for an important meeting with a book publisher, who wants to publish a book about me because I am famous.

TSA agent: That's not—

BoJack: Fine, you want me to dance? I'll dance. Give me ten seconds, Diane. This guy's being a total fascist. Diane? Diane?

Diane: Over here, BoJack.

BoJack: How'd you get through so fast?

Diane: I followed the basic requirements for air travel that have been in place for over a decade.

BoJack: Ugh, weird.

TSA agent: Sir, whoever you are, please—

BoJack: Really? You've never heard of my TV show? You know very well who I am. And now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to New York.

ALL: Ah, no. More? Come on!

BoJack: Oh, you know what? Could be this.

TSA agent: Oh, my God, he's got a gun!

BoJack: Relax, it's a lighter. How much lighter fluid can I take on the plane? And before you answer, remember, I'm a celebrity.

TSA agent: We're gonna need a full body cavity search.

    NEW-YORK 

    "e-PUBLISHER" 
    "PENGUIN PUBLISHING" 
    "iPELIGRO! DECLARADO EN RUINA INMINENTE ASBESTOS" 

Pinky Penguin: Thanks for coming to New York for this. Let's just say, it's better for everyone's kneecaps if I stay out of California for a little bit.

BoJack: Always nice to get a change of scenery, am I right?

Pinky: I think the New York air's been good for my health. I mean, I did find a lump, but hey, who needs health insurance when you've got BoJack Horseman writing a book, huh? How's it coming along?

Diane: It's great. I'm pumping out heartfelt anecdotes and witty observations left and right, and this one is spinning it all into gold.

    Ira Glass: Your telephone is ringing. I'm Ira Glass. Thank you for being a sustaining member of public radio. Everyone has a story, and your phone's story is that it's ringing. 

Diane: Excuse me. Hello?

BoJack: Hurry back, superstar. (to Pinky) I don't think Diane's working out.

Pinky: What? Why? Is Diane no good?

BoJack: She's too good. I don't know if Diane is damaged enough to tell my story. She's so— functional.

Pinky: Oh, I'm so sorry, Mr.Horseman, she's too functional. Why don't I just get on the phone and call a less functional (screaming)) What are you talking about?! This is a very bad time, BoJack!

BoJack: All right.

Pinky: You need to promise me that your book will be on the shelves and making money by October!

BoJack: All right. Jesus.

Diane: Uh-huh? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Got it. Sorry, I took so long.

BoJack: Who was that? The library? Thanking you for never returning a book late?

Diane: That was my brother Tommy. My dad just died.

BoJack: Oh, my God.

Diane: Did we talk about firming up the release date? I was thinking late September.

BoJack: I am so sorry.

Diane: It's fine, he was old and also the worst.

Pinky: Such a terrible tragedy really puts everything in perspective. Where does that leave us as far as the book of it all?

Diane: Not a problem. I just got to swing by Boston and give my condolences real quick. BoJack can come with me. We'll get some work done while we're there, and then that way the whole trip won't be a total waste of time.

Pinky: Great. Call me if you need anything, but hang up after one ring, and I'll call you back from the phone booth where my wife and I are living.

    L.A. 

Todd: (sings) Todd bless these scrambled eggs Eggs from the fridge Sunny side them And guide them—

BoJack's voice: Todd, stop singing your dumb scrambled eggs song.

Todd: Who said that?

BoJack's voice: If you're wondering who said that, it's this note that you're reading. You're hearing my voice in your head, because that's how reading works.

Todd: Oh, yeah.

BoJack's voice: As you might've noticed, Todd, I've left you home alone for the day, and frankly, I already regret that decision. Here's what you need to do: —Nothing. Don't touch my stuff, and don't make a mess. Pick me up at the airport tomorrow, and until then—don't, do, anything.

Todd: Well, seal's broken. Might as well enjoy myself. Whee! Cheers to bath time. Great story, Todd. I love our friendship. Here we go! The Great Toddini!

Guide: And here we have the home of a truly dynamic and unique talent, TV's own David Boreanaz.

ALL: Ohh!

Guide: Sounds like we have some fans of Person of Interest on board, or Castle, or whatever his show is.

Todd: Sorry, dudes, you got the wrong house.

ALL: Aww.

Tourist One: Crikey, I would've paid $50 U.S. to see where David Boreanaz lives. He's the American Hugh Jackman.

Todd: Oh, yeah, 50 bucks?

Tourist Two: He's so good in Burn Notice.

Todd: What? 50 bucks? In that case, come on in, friends. Some guy named David Boreanaz lives here.

ALL: Hooray!

    "WELCOME TO BOSTON" 

BoJack: Hey, so listen, I really want to be here for you in your time of need, but I'm not really good with funerals or death or families or feelings or people.

Diane: Don't worry. You can wait in the car. It's probably better you don't meet my brothers. They're narrow-minded, mean-spirited dirt-bags.

BoJack: I wish I had brothers growing up. Touch football on the weekends, noogie parades on the reg. Life as an only child can get pretty lonely.

    Flashback 

Young BoJack: Daddy, do you want to meet my imaginary friend?

Butterscotch: Imaginary friends are freeloaders invented by communists to rip-off welfare. Why don't you do something productive, like bang your head against the wall until your brain isn't so stupid?

Young BoJack: Okay, Daddy.

    NOW 

Diane: Yeah, well, I was pretty lonely, too. My family made my life miserable, and then they never forgave me for leaving.

BoJack: So, what, you're like the black sheep?

Diane: No, Gary's the black sheep. He's adopted. I'm just a member of the family nobody likes. And my dad was the worst of them all.

BoJack: You told me that you and your father used to sit on the roof and look at the stars together.

Diane: Oh, yeah, I was just trying to get you to open up, so I used an old writer's trick called "me lying to you."

BoJack: Oh, yeah? Well, I'm using an old me trick called "that hurts my feelings."

Diane: And the truth is, I used to sit alone on the hill out by the dump and dream of waking up as Chelsea Clinton, but with my hair.

BoJack: You do have great hair.

Diane: I know. That's us. I'll just pop in for a quick hi and bye. Then we'll be on our way. Ten minutes, swear to God. You can play with this kaleidoscope I got you at the airport.

BoJack: What? A kaleidoscope? I'm not five.. Shapes and colors the likes of which I've never seen.

Diane: Hello.

Tommy: Hey, yeah, Deedee came home! Gary, Marty, Artie, Deedee's back! Come here!

Marty: Game. Watching the game. Can't look up from the game. How you doing?

Diane: Marty, it's a game from '86. You've seen it a hundred times.

Marty: And how many times does Buckner break your heart?

BOTH: 100 times.

Artie: Aw, thank God you're here, Deedee. Pops is wicked departed.

Tommy: Oh, yeah, man. He departed so hard. And I do not like them apples, Deedee.

Marty: Yo, Deedee, get me a beer.

Gary: Yeah, make that two, Deedee.

Diane: Gary, Marty, I just got home.

Artie: Ooh, Princess Diane doesn't want to get her brother a beer.

Gary: Hey, Ma, come look what the Pats dragged in.

Ma: Oh, hello! Look who decided to come home. Queen Deedee blesses us with her presence. To what do I owe the honor?

Diane: Look, I'm just here to offer my condolences.

Ma: Oh, sure, in and out, like a Protestant on Christmas. Why would you want to stick around, be with your family in their time of need?

Diane: Come on, Ma.

Marty: Don't fight while the game's on. It's bad Juju.

Diane: It's the '86 World Series. They lose.

Marty: Ah, why'd you have to

Ma: Oh, we're just a bunch of savages, right? We're not like your fancy California friends. Your George Clooney and your California Raisins.

Tommy: Oh, come off it, Ma. She don't mean no harm.

Ma: For five years she didn't come home. Why don't you make like A-Rod and blow.

Diane: Well, this was clearly a huge mistake.

Tommy: Ah, don't go. Deedee, please.

Diane: Why not? Ma doesn't want me here.

Tommy: Ma don't know what she wants. She wants you here. We all do. Ain't that right, Marty?

Marty: Can't look up from the game.

Tommy: Besides, we need your help organizing all the funeral stuff. We didn't go to college. We're not smart like you.

Diane: Fine, I'll help. Is there a number for me to call?

Tommy: Yeah, try 8-800, dummy, Jeez, do some legwork, Dee. And do it quick. The ice is melting.

Diane: Oh, my God. Is that dad? Did someone draw balls on his forehead?

Artie: That was before we knew he was dead. We just thought he was wicked hung over.

Gary: In your face, Dad! In your face forever.

    L.A. 

Todd: Welcome to the home of David Boreanaz, famous from television shows such as dramas on networks. That will be $50 please.

Tourist One: Oy, mate, this picture of David Boreanaz fell apart.

Todd: Oh, no, no, no, I'll handle that. Why don't you just go look through David Boreanaz's underwear drawer, okay? It's in his bedroom.

Tourist One: Oh, knickers.

BoJack's voice: Hey, what do you think you're doing?

Todd: Uh-oh, am I reading something again?

BoJack's voice: No, this is your conscience. BoJack trusted you to take care of his house. Is this really..? What are you doing?

    "Dun-dun-dun-dun" 
    "Dun-dun-dun" 

Todd: It's a great day on Todd's phone. How can I help you?

Princess Carolyn: (in VIGOR, on the phone) Are you trying to cut me out of this David Boreanaz deal? I'm your agent, damn it.

Todd: How'd you find out about Boreanaz House?

Princess Carolyn: Don't worry, I'm not just gonna sit here batting a ball of yarn around while you do the real work. I want to take your project to the next level. We need to go bigger. Have you thought about attaching Mila Kunis to this thing?

Todd: Attach her? How?

Princess Carolyn: You do your job. I'll do mine.

Todd: Who is this?

    BOSTON 

BoJack: Ah, out of combinations. Now I'm bored. Diaa-aane!

Tommy: You show me nothing

Artie: What do you want from me?

Ma: You have no right to barge in here after five years and judge us, Diane.

Diane: I'm just saying Marty could lend a hand instead of sitting on the couch watching the game all day.

Marty: Ah, Deedee.

Ma: You know very well his leg's still sore from the accident at the quarry.

Gary: Yeah, he's got to rest up if he's gonna be a wide receiver for B.C.

Diane: He didn't get into B.C.

Artie: Ah, what's the point of getting off the couch anyway? All the jobs are going to immigrants these days.

Diane: What do you..? We're immigrants.

Artie: How do you figure?

Diane: We're Vietnamese?

Artie: Step off! We're American as Pho!

Gary: And that's the same crap you always pull--

Artie: What do you want from me?

Gary: Come on! Leave me alone.

Tommy: You show me nothing

BoJack: Excuse me. Yes, hello, I'm looking for Diane. Does anyone here speak English?

Tommy: Pull over and park the car. Is that the frickin' horse from Horsin' Around?

BoJack: Again, does anyone here speak English?

Artie: Oh, no way

Gary: What? A TV star!

    L.A. 

Princess Carolyn: Boreanaz house. Seventy-five each. Children and seniors free.

Todd: Please stay behind the ropes and keep your hands and belongings on your person at all times. Next we'll head to the kitchen where.. Is that Mila Kunis?

ALL: Ooh!

Todd: Note the letters B.H. on all hand towels and linens. That stands for "Boreanaz House."

    BOSTON 

Diane: Yeah, do you pick up bodies? Is that a service you provide? Corpse removal?

Tommy: Hey, BoJack, you ever meet any Boston celebrities?

BoJack: Well, one time at Bristol Farms, Ben Affleck and I did reach for the same bunch of grapes.

Tommy: Oh, he eats grapes just like us? Hey, Ma, Ben Affleck eats grapes!

[Ma:] He don't eat grapes!

Tommy: BoJack said he fed Affleck grapes. He was graping it up with the Daredevil himself. This is the greatest day of my life.

Diane: Oh!

BoJack: Hey, I don't suppose you boys would have any interest in maybe playing some touch football later?

Tommy: Are you kidding? Touch football with a star like you? That would be mad wicked pisser.

Artie: Ooh, you know what else we got to do? We got to watch the Cryane video.

BoJack: Ooh, that sounds good. What's that?

Diane: No, we don't need to revisit that.

Marty: When Deedee was 16, we made up a secret pen pal for her named Leo.

Diane: Guys, I really would rather not discuss it.

Artie: We all took turns writing her letters, pretending to be this sensitive boy from Cambridge.

Tommy: It was wicked messed up.

Gary: "Oh, Diane, we're two misunderstood souls. Everyone else is a phony. Yours forever, Leo."

BoJack: What? That is amazing.

Artie: After six months of letters, we hired a homeless guy to pretend to be Leo and take her to the homecoming dance.

Marty: Look at her.

Gary: Watch, watch this part.

    TV: Diane: "I like your boutonniere." 

Marty: Why don't we watch this every day?

Gary: Look at her face.

BoJack: Now that's a good prank.

Diane: I was humiliated.

BoJack: Yeah, you wouldn't get it. It's a brothers thing, right, brothers?

ALL: Whoo!

Gary: That's Cryane for you. What a pussy.

Tommy: You know, it's nice that years later we can all laugh about this.

Diane: Yep, my therapist thinks the same thing. I'm gonna go meet with the funeral director. Any of you boys want to come?

Marty: Nah, I ain't so big on funeral homes, Deedee. All them dead bodies, they give me the jeebies.

Artie: Yeah, Deedee, why do we got to go?

Diane: Fine, none of you have to go. I'll take care of everything.

Tommy: Thank you, Diane. We all really appreciate it.

Diane: Come on, BoJack.

Tommy: Why you got to take BoJack with you?!

ALL: Boo! Boo!

BoJack: Boys, you have stolen my heart like Dave Roberts stole second base.

Gary: Hey! He knows our things!

BoJack: I must go now, but I'll see you all at the funeral, okay? And when I do, you're all getting noogies.

Brothers: Funeral! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Funeral! Funeral! Funeral!

    L.A. 

Todd: And now, a very special treat just for our platinum members. Let's take a peek at the slumbering Mr.Boreanaz himself.

Todd's voice: Get out of my room, Todd! I'm David Boreanaz.

ALL: Ohh!

Todd: And thus concludes our tour. Have a Boreanderful day.


    BOSTON, "Maggot & Sons Funeral Home" 

F.D.: Tell me about your father.

Diane: Well, he was a mean, sadistic alcoholic, who never supported anything I did and actively delighted in seeing me fail.

F.D.: Hmm, I see. Sounds like you're looking for our "Piece of Shit Dad Package."

Diane: That would be too good for my father.

F.D.: Hmm, I see. Might I then suggest our "Piece of Shit Dad Package Would Be Too Good For Him Package."

Diane: Yeah, that's the one.

F.D.: Excellent choice.

BoJack: Hey, can I suggest something? You might want to loosen up a little. I think you could actually learn a thing or two from your brothers.

Diane: Are you kidding? If I was like my brothers, nothing would ever get done.

BoJack: I'm just saying, if you can't find a way to let off some steam you're going to explode. ("Unknown Caller") God damn it! Are you god damn kidding me? I keep getting calls from this unlisted number. Ignore. Who are these assholes?

Diane: Why don't you just answer, and then you'll know?

BoJack: Oh, they'd just love that, wouldn't they?

    L.A. 

Robin: Ugh, how are we supposed to blackmail him if we can't reach him?

Blue Jay: Maybe we got to get him where he lives?

Robin: You mean?

Blue Jay: That's right, his house.

    BH's House 

Blue Jay: What the.. Whose house is this?

Robin: Is that David Boreanaz?

Blue Jay: I could've sworn BoJack Horseman lived here.

Princess Carolyn: Hey, let's keep these lines moving, huh? You want to stop and chat, you gotta pay for the extended stay ticket.

Todd: Ah, so much, so much, so much.

Princess Carolyn: Another five Gs, T-Bag, and we are in the pink.

Todd: I don't know, Princess Carolyn. I ran out of shoeboxes for the money, and the books aren't adding up. Plus the men's lav' needs to be serviced, and I had to fire Janine in the gift shop for stealing Boreabble heads. I mean, how did I end up with all this responsibility?

Princess Carolyn: Hey, I'm not screwing around here, small fry. You better make those numbers sing.

Todd: I don't think these offshore banks we've been using are 100% legal.

Princess Carolyn: Yeah, well, my mother told me never to slap an idiot.

Todd: What? (she slaps him) Ow!

Princess Carolyn: Now we're both breaking the rules. You listen, and you listen good. I've gotten used to a certain lifestyle since Boreanaz House went public, and I'm not going back to the old way. Mommy likes her shoes, see? And her pearls.

Todd: Oh, I'm in too deep. I don't know what to do.

BoJack's voice: I'll tell you what you should do.

Todd: Who said that?

BoJack's voice: It's me, David Boreanaz.

Todd: Is that what David Boreanaz sounds like?

BoJack's voice: Uh, sure. Let me give you some advice. As we say on my show I want to say, New Girl? just keep doing what you're doing, and you'll be fine.

Todd: Wow, thanks, Davie B.

BoJack's voice: Never call me that!

    BOSTON, "MAGGOT & SONS Funeral Home" 

Diane: Unbelievable.

BoJack: It's 4:00. I don't think anyone's coming.

Diane: Unbe-goddamn-lievable! All those jerkwads had to do was show up, and they couldn't even do that! Where's the body even?

F.D.: Beg your pardon, minor hiccup. My goons went to pick your father up, but nobody was home. For a nominal fee, we can scrounge up another body for you. Would you care to peruse our loaner closet?

    BAR 

Diane: Hey, assholes! Where were you? I planned the whole funeral, like you asked me to, and nobody showed.

Tommy: Yeah, we realized dad wouldn't have wanted some stuffy funeral.

Gary: He would've wanted his body to be chopped up into chum and thrown in Derek Jeter's fat face.

Artie: Yeah, suck it, Jeter!

Diane: Wait, what? Where is Dad?

Tommy: We got him chummed. He's in the truck.

Diane: You chummed Dad?

Ma: It's what your father wanted, honey, but then you wouldn't know anything about that, would you?

Diane: Let me get this straight. So instead of coming to the funeral that I paid for and spent all day organizing, you had* Dad's body ground into chum, so you could throw his mushy remains on Derek Jeter?

Gary: No, not just on) Derek Jeter. We're gonna throw it into his fat face.

Ma: Yeah, his fat face.

Brothers: In his fat face.

Tommy: The Yankees are in town this week. The planets are aligning, Deedee.

Diane: Tommy, you begged me to stay and help.

Ma: Why does everything always got to be about big-shot Diane? Too good for her home.

Diane: I don't think I'm too good for my home.

BoJack: Yeah, guys, you got it all wrong. Diane isn't a big-shot. She's my ghostwriter. She's writing a book that's not even gonna have her name on it. You think this is how she expected her life would be going at 34? She lives with her rich boyfriend and doesn't pay rent. She's not too good for anything.

Tommy: What?

Marty: Diane's a freeloader?

(all laughing)

Marty: Even I pay rent.

BoJack: BoJack helping?

Diane: AHH!!!

BoJack: Whoa!

Diane: This is why I told you to wait in the car!!

Gary: Oh, she snapped. Here comes Cryane.

Tommy: Hey, hey, Deedee, come on.

Ma: Diane, you are making a public spectacle of yourself.

Tommy: Deedee, what are you doing with Dad's keys? Put those back.

Gary: Oh, come on, that's Dad's truck. Dad's chum is in the back. No! No, no, no!

[Diane:] Suck a dick, dumb shits!

Gary: Well, that crazy clam did it. She took Pops.

Marty: Oh, no, what are we gonna do?

    "Three minutes Later" 

TV: And it's a one-hopper back to the pitcher. Easy out at first.

BoJack: So.. what we're gonna do is.. nothing?

Marty: Sox are on, and I haven't seen this one.

BoJack: Does anyone know where she might have gone?

Artie: Ah, she used to run off like this all the time in high school, too. Who knows where crazy goes?

BoJack: I think I know where she went.

Tommy: Wait, you can't leave. The party's just getting started.

BoJack: I don't know, Diane was pretty upset, and she's got your dad.

Gary: Oh, don't go, BoJack. You're like the fifth brother I never had.

BoJack: I.. Really?

Tommy: Yeah, don't leave, bro. After this, we'll go play touch football and do a noogie parade.

BoJack: Ah, um..

    L.A. 

[Fuzzyface:] Everyone please disperse. This is an unlawful gathering. Disperse immediately.

Todd: Oh, this isn't looking good, Princess Carolyn. What are we gonna do?

Princess Carolyn: What do you mean, we? Princess Carolyn always.. lands on her feet. Ha!

Fuzzyface: Mr.Boreanaz, I presume.

Todd: Um, would you like a Boreabble head?

Mr. Peanutbutter: (on the phone) The amazing thing is, the house looks just like BoJack's house. They must have the same architect. Anyway, how are things with you?

    "BOSTON's DUMP" 

[Diane:] (on the phone) Not good. I should've known it was a waste of time to come back here.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Oh, that's awful. Well, when you get back, I'll give you one of my patented Peanutbutter hugs. Crunchy and creamy.

Diane: You know that patent wasn't approved, but.. I'll take it. I have to go. BoJack's here.

[Mr. Peanutbutter:] BoJack, well, what's he doing?

BoJack: Hey. Sorry, I said all that stuff about you.

Diane: It's all true, isn't it?

BoJack: I found this letter back at the bar. I think it's for you. Look, just read it. I think you'll like it.

Diane: "Dear Diane, it's me, your old pen pal Leo. This definitely isn't BoJack Horseman writing this."

BoJack: Keep reading.

Diane:"You're a good person, Diane, and that's the most important thing. Even if no one appreciates you, it's important that you don't stop being good. I like how you always bring your own bags to the grocery store, and how you're always organized to go places. I like how you chew gum on the airplane so your ears will pop. A lot of people might not appreciate that about you, but I do. Yours forever, Leo." That's the best letter he ever wrote me.

BoJack: Look, take it from someone with his own shitty parents, family is a sinkhole, and you were right to get out when you had the chance.

Diane: The stupid thing is, even now I still just want them to be proud of me and think I did good. Is that really stupid?

BoJack: Yep.

Diane: No, it isn't.

BoJack: Yeah, it is! You want those guys to be proud of you?

Diane: I guess I was just hoping to get some modicum of closure.

BoJack: Closure is a made up thing by Steven Spielberg to sell movie tickets. It, like true love and the Munich Olympics, doesn't exist in the real world. The only thing to do now is just to keep living forward.

Diane: Yeah, but every time I come back here they--

BoJack: So don't come back here. What's great about Los Angeles is nobody cares about where you're from or who you are. It's a superficial town where you can worry about stupid shit like keeping your pool clean, and what artisanal nuts to put on your salad.

Diane: I do like salad.

BoJack: Oh, it's the best. Why do you think people keep moving there?

Diane: Thanks, BoJack.

BoJack: The good news is, your dad can't hurt anyone ever again. Uh-oh.

Old Lady: Ah!

    "Only at Fenway -- Ba-dum, ba-da-dum" 

BoJack: Um, I'll meet you inside. I have to make a call.

Diane: Okay.

Herb's voice: It's Herb. You know what to do.

BoJack: Hey, Herb, look, I think we have some unfinished business. It seems like life's too short to hold grudges and stuff like that, you know what I'm saying? About life being too short? Well, of course you know what I'm saying. You're the one with terminal.. I feel like I'm doing all the talking here. So anyway, I thought maybe we could chat. Why don't you give me a call, okay? Um.. so smell you later? This is BoJack. Horseman. Obviously. ("Unknown Caller") Ugh, who keeps calling me?

Mr. Peanutbutter: BoJack Horseman! Put her there!

BoJack: That's all right.

Mr. Peanutbutter: I'm gonna get that handshake.

BoJack: No, you're not.

Diane: Since when am I Honey?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Since now. I made up the nickname while you were back east.

BoJack: Yeah, really? You made up calling someone honey?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Uh, I do believe so. Yes.

Diane: Hey, why don't we give BoJack a ride?

BoJack: That's okay. Todd's supposed to pick me up. Where is he?

Man: (to Todd) First day, huh? Ha-ha. Well, stick with me. You're gonna be just fi..

Todd: Oh!

BoJack: Probably just forgot, the lazy bum. Hey, I'll take the ride as long as it's not as bumpy as that pilot's landing.

Diane: That was seriously very scary.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Hey

Diane: I'm just glad you were there, because I really would have freaked out by myself.

BoJack: Be stiller, my beating heart.

Diane: Stiller crazy after all these years.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Did I miss something funny? I love funny somethings.

Diane: No, we were just laughing about this Ben Stiller article from the plane.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Ooh, he is the best. What did it say?

BoJack: You wouldn't get it. Either you read Hemisphere's Magazine, or you don't.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Hey, I might be crazy, because this is such a dumb question, and I'm embarrassed to even ask, but -- do I have anything to worry about with you and Diane?

BoJack: Wha-a-a-a-a-t? What? Get out of here.

Mr. Peanutbutter: I got to say, BoJack, that is a relief. Ho-ho! Whoo!

BoJack: Hey, do you guys want to grab dinner? Or at least some road sodas, so I don't have to go through the ordeal of sobering up and then having to get drunk all over again?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Oh, I actually already made special plans for just the two of us.

Diane: Oh, come on. You're the one who's always saying you want to hang out with BoJack more, and how it's weird that BoJack never returns your calls, and how I should hang up the phone because maybe BoJack's trying to call you right now.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Uh, okay. I guess we can make this work.

BoJack: Oh. Oh, man. Remember that guy in 34-B?

Diane: Do I? Can't stop remembering him.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Uh, hey. Diane and I have memories, too. This place reminds me of a cliff side meal we had one romantic vacay to Cabo.

BoJack: Boring. I wasn't there. Can we keep this general interests?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Well, here's to a meal we're all here for.

Diane: Mmm. Oh, oh. Ew. There's something in my food.

BoJack: Ah, crap. Someone get the manager.

Mr. Peanutbutter: No, no, no. Wait. It's supposed to be in there. Welcome home, honey. I got you a D-pendant, because I am D-pendant on you.

Diane: Thank you.

BoJack: Yeah. Real.. Real cute. A 'D' for dog.

Mr. Peanutbutter: It's for Diane.

Diane: This is the sweetest choking hazard anyone's ever given me. Mwah.

BoJack: Well, how about some champagne for the happy couple. Waiter, get me a bottle of Dom to keep with the trend of sweet D gifts.

Mr. Peanutbutter: You're too kind, but everyone knows you go off menu for the good stuff. Yes, get me your most expensive bottle, from the back. Perhaps a 1922-ish Heidsieck Diamant Bleu?

BoJack: A toast on me to Diane and Mr.Peanutbutter. I'd like a round of drinks for everyone. Off the menu, of course.

Mr. Peanutbutter: BoJack, folks. What a sport. And while we're all in giving moods, I'd like to buy you all an Xbox, courtesy of me.

Diane: Wow. You guys don't have to do this.

BoJack: Look, I could happily go down this petty road of raising and re-raising one another.

Man: Please do!

BoJack: But I'd instead like to highlight the fact that Mr.Peanutbutter's ripping off my toast the same way he ripped off my entire career.

Man: Uh, we prefer gifts over observations.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Okay. Well, here's something I didn't rip off. This brand new helicopter I just bought. Whoo-whoo! Who wants a ride in the chopper?

Diane: Okay, guys. This has been fun, and also an offensive display of extravagant wealth, but maybe we should call it a night.

BoJack: What's the rush? Because I just bought the restaurant, and we can stay as long as we want. Hey, you. I own you now. Do a dance.

Todd: When you say "the gang," do you mean a) gang?

Klaus: Check this out. If you want to lift weights, we got great yard connections. If you like toilet wine, we spent the past 20 years perfecting pruno. The Aryan nation is number one for a reason.

Todd: Never thought I'd say this, but you put a pretty good spin on Nazis.

Todd: I'm sorry, but I'm in jail, dude.

BoJack: Well, you called the right person, because I need your help and you're my phone-a-friend. Marie Curie won Nobel prizes in which two sciences? A, chemistry and physics. B, biology and physics..

Todd: Oh, B! The answer's B!

Mr. Peanutbutter: It's A!

TV, Tom Jumbo-Grumbo: It's a Holly-who-done-it as police are scrambling to figure out who stole the D from the famed Hollywood sign.

BoJack: Holly-what?

Tom Jumbo-Grumbo: All of Tinseltown's at DEFCON 5 until their diabolically displaced D is demonstrably displayed once more. Can we cool it with the alliteration? Who wrote this copy? Randy, looking at you.

BoJack: Weird. .. Weirder! Why the hell would I steal a giant D?

Diane: Ding-dong! It's Diane.

BoJack: D.. D.. Damn!

Tom Jumbo-Grumbo: Meanwhile, local authorities are already investigating several suspects. David Duchovny, Dick Van Dyke, DMX, and of course Dane Cook, who we all know is a thief.

BoJack: Hey, D-voted memoirist. I can't work on the book today. Too ill. Cough.

Diane: Are you ill, or hung-over? Because instead of coughing you just said the word cough. Plus you left me a long, drunken voice-mail last night.

BoJack: Ooh, was it bad?

BoJack: It was mostly a lot of wheezing, as if you were climbing something, followed by the sounds of dismantling metal, and then grunting like you were dragging something heavy at least a few miles.

BoJack: I didn't say anything incriminating, did I?

Diane: As incriminating as that question? No.

BoJack: Good. Well, just as a general rule, you probably shouldn't be listening to any voicemails I leave after.. What time do I start drinking?

Diane: Noon?

BoJack: Yup. See you later.

Diane: But we had an appointment.

BoJack: What's that? An actor flaking on an obligation? Welcome to Hollywood.

Diane: I think you mean Hollywoo. Did you see? Someone stole the D off the sign.

BoJack: Cough, cough, cough, cough, cough. Cough, cough, cough, cough, door slam.

Princess Carolyn: What is it, BoJack? You know, I'm tied up with all my Deans today. Kane, Norris, Winters, and Koontz, all being questioned by police.

BoJack: It was me. I stole the D.

Princess Carolyn: What?

BoJack: Now be a good agent and make this not my problem.

Princess Carolyn: How did you even? You know, your scandal-to-work ratio is, like, five to one?

BoJack: Look, I need to get rid of this before Diane sees it.

Princess Carolyn: Why do you care if Dia.. Oh, fish. Are you in love with your biographer?

BoJack: Wha-a-a-at? Ha-ha. What? Get out of here.

Princess Carolyn: You stole the D for Diane. Unbelievable!

BoJack: Yeah, I don't know. The D might be for David, because apparently when I was drunk, I printed out a bunch of pictures of David Boreanaz.

Princess Carolyn: Yeah.. You did that. Look, I'll keep your little crush busy long enough for you to get rid of the contraband, but the next three weddings I'm invited to, you're my date, dummy.

BoJack: Since when to women your age get invited to weddings?

Princess Carolyn: I have a lot of nieces and nephews!

Mr. Peanutbutter: Well, you pulled it off, you deviant. Get it? D-viant?

BoJack: I got it.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Tell me, how are you gonna complete your giant bracelet? With the chain-link fence from Dodger's Stadium?

BoJack: No. How'd you figure out it was me?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Oh, how did I figure it out? Well, I just followed the clues, used deduction, puzzle-solving, a little bit of forensics, and also, what did I do? Oh, I listened to the voice-mail you left me saying you were stealing the D because of Diane so I could, and I quote, "Suck your D."

BoJack: Stop leaving voicemails!

Mr. Peanutbutter: Admit it! You like my girlfriend!

BoJack: Oh, come on. I mean, am I attracted to her? Sure. Do my days feel better when I'm around her? Yeah. Does she get me in ways no woman ever has? Indubitably. Do I fantasize about her? Yes, but only in two positions. Look, am I the kind of guy who would try to steal someone else's girlfriend? Sure, of course, but do I like her? The answer's no. You have nothing to worry about.

Mr. Peanutbutter: I'll cut you a deal. I help you get rid of that D, and you never talk to Diane again.

BoJack: Well, I have to talk to her, because she's writing my book.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Okay, but just don't pursue her romantically?

BoJack: Oh, that's just a mustard packet. It's left over from lunch.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Oh. Well, can we move it off the table?

BoJack: No. I still might want it later.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Good call. So how do we get the D from here all the way up to here? What, with all these cops and mustards, it's gonna be a pickle.

BoJack: Oh, no. The pickle's a SWAT van, but I see your point. Might be easier to just ditch the evidence. But how?

Mr. Peanutbutter: I.. I don't know. You think these coffees would get the juices flowing.

BoJack: Well, they do have Bailey's in them.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Is that why I feel drunk? Because I've had, like, seven or eight coffees.

BoJack: I mean, I admit, it's been bad for ideas, but it's been great for camaraderie.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Couldn't agree more. Ooh, hey. What time is it? I probably need to move my helicopter. It's in a two-hour zone.

BoJack: You beautiful bastard, that's it! We can pick up the D with your chopper, fly it out of here, and then dump it out into the ocean.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Stupendous! Take that, the ocean.

BoJack: What now, Todd?

Todd: Listen. So, kind of landed myself in a two-dates-to-the-prom situation. The dates being prison gangs and the prom being a jump-in, so do you remember how you got out of the same jam on Horsin' Around?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Ah, a classic conundrum. Well, I recall one time on Mr.Peanutbutter's House..

BoJack: I think he's talking to me, pal. You know, the guy whose show invented the two-dates-to-the-prom story.

Mr. Peanutbutter: You may have invented it, but I think our show perfected it.

BoJack: The only thing you ever perfected -- was stealing my thunder.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Stealing your thunder, eh?

BoJack: Now you're even stealing the words I'm saying.

Todd: You know, it's tough. I agree with the Latin Kings on social issues, but fiscally I'm more of an Aryan.

BoJack: Well, juggling both never ends well. Mr.Peanutbutter, anything to contribute? He's just staring blankly now.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Stealing, your, thunder.

Todd: You could also just bail me out of here, as I said. It's only 50 bucks..

BoJack: Mr.Peanutbutter took my D and gave it to Diane. Once again, he completely ripped me off.

Princess Carolyn: Oh, right. That whole thing. Just a minute, Cate. Look, you may have come up with a log line, but he's the one who sold the pitch. This is more on brand for him than it is for you.

BoJack: What do you mean?

Princess Carolyn: Desecrated a major landmark in a drunken stupor, that's a BoJack Horseman thing. But stealing it for your girlfriend as a grand display of affection? That's Mr.Peanutbutter.

BoJack: You're right. It's Mr. Peanutbutter all over.

Princess Carolyn: It's the kind of bold, romantic gesture they base movies on. Actually, that's not a bad idea. Laura? Check if anyone's bought the rights yet.

BoJack: Can we keep this about me, please?

Princess Carolyn: Even if he stole your stealing of the D, what he made his was telling Diane how he felt from his heart. You could never say it to me, and you still can't say it to her.

BoJack: That's not true. I can express feelings.

BoJack: Thank you for rescheduling given your recent, uh, everything.

Diane: Yeah. That was really .. something.

BoJack: I guess he makes your heart stand Stiller?

Diane: Yeah, but for some reason the jury's Stiller out on how I feel about it.

BoJack: Well, that's because it wasn't for you. That wasn't a Diane thing. It was a Mr.Peanutbutter thing.

Diane: Well, what would be a Diane thing?

BoJack: A Diane thing would be something that shows he really knows you, like giving you an iPod loaded with all your favorite podcasts, or a practical houseplant, or surprising you with a bound album of photos and emails he saved. That's.. That's what the Diane I know would want.

Diane: What are you saying to me?

BoJack: Just that you should be with someone who knows you.

Mr. Peanutbutter: I know I sometimes get carried away, but it's because I love you so much. You're a catch, Diane, and I think you know how much I love catch.

BoJack: And I'm sorry if I've been.. difficult in any way during this process. You know, it's-- It's really hard to have somebody, I don't know, know you, I guess. And you do, uh, know me, Diane.

Mr. Peanutbutter: We're very different, but I think we bring out the best in each other. It's like you're chocolate and I'm--

Diane: Peanutbutter?

Mr. Peanutbutter: What? Now see? That was so much better than what I was gonna say. I was gonna say carrots.

Diane: ha-ha-ha

BoJack: And I know I'm not the perfect guy. I actually kind of hate myself a lot of the time. But when When I'm with you, I, uh, don't hate myself. I like being around you, and I don't know if I ever told you that in so many words, so I'm telling you.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Diane, I've got an important question to ask. No cameras, no big spectacle. Just me, and, you.

BoJack: Call me back. This was BoJack, by the way. Horseman, obviously.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Will you do me the honor.. Of becoming Mrs.Peanutbutter?

Diane: Wow. This is happening so fast. Yes. I'll marry you. But I'm keeping my last name.

Mr. Peanutbutter: You hear that? She said yes!! Let's kick it! Erica, did you hear she said yes? Come on in here! All right!

BoJack: She's not gonna call. Get out the consolation scotch. It's her! Make that celebration scotch.

Bartender: What's the difference?

BoJack: (on the phone) It's the same scotch! Diane! Hey, you!

Diane: Hey. So this is weird. I'm engaged.

BoJack: Oh, wow. To Mr.Peanutbutter?

Diane: I saw you left me a voice-mail

BoJack: Delete it. It's just a drunken recipe for Bundt cake. Not important.

Diane: Okay. I got to go. They're about to move the D back. See you tomorrow?

BoJack: Absolutely. Well, nobody knows me like you.

Pilot: Time to bring this baby home. To think I went from flying missions over Kandahar to this cushy crap. (CRASH) I spoke too soon! Black Hawk down! Black Hawk down!

Todd: See, you guys aren't so different.

Klaus: We're free! We're free!

LKGL: Yeah!

Klaus: Freedom! I am free! Freedom!

Todd: Oh, wow. What a twist, huh? And they say there's no new stories in Hollywoo. (sighs) 

Princess Carolyn: You got to get your shit together. So you took some licks, but you're gonna bounce back, because you're talented, you're smart, and damn it, you're good. You are a goddamn American treasure, you know that? You are BoJack goddamn Horseman. So get the hell off my lawn.

BoJack: Oh. Here I thought I was at the drive-through at Carl's Jr. How much did I have to drink last night?

Princess Carolyn: Last night? Oh, you've been on a bender for the last two weeks, ever since you found out Diane got engaged to Mr.Peanutbutter.

BoJack: Diane got engaged to Mr.Peanutbutter? I need a drink.

Princess Carolyn: No. No more drinking. You've been out of control.

BoJack: Princess Carolyn, look. I met John Stamos.

Princess Carolyn: That is not John Stamos.

BoJack: Hey, Princess Carolyn, John Stamos and I got our ears pierced.

Princess Carolyn: That is not your ear.

BoJack: Princess Carolyn, John Stamos died. Why? Why, God? Why did you take John Stamos?

BoJack: That doesn't sound so bad.

Princess Carolyn: Oh, I forgot to mention you were naked for a lot of that.

BoJack: Stamos!

Princess Carolyn: Also, it wasn't here. It was at my office.

BoJack: We thought night swimming would be fun, but the current was too strong.

BoJack: Oh, God, I wasn't driving around, was I?

Princess Carolyn: No. You made Todd your designated driver, but then you also made him drink with you.

Todd: Yeah, I'll have a western bacon cheeseburger.

Princess Carolyn: BoJack, we are going to get you back on your feet. All you need to do is get off Diane and get on to something else.

Tony: Hello?

Princess Carolyn: Tony, hi. I'm calling in that favor. Get your crew to BoJack Horseman's house. Can you be there in an hour?

Tony: Yeah.

Princess Carolyn: Great.

BoJack: What just happened?

Princess Carolyn: You're the new face of Guten Bourbon.

BoJack: What is Guten Bourbon?

Princess Carolyn: It's an urban German bourbon.

BoJack: Am I just hungover, or are you talking like a Muppet?

Princess Carolyn: They're looking for American celebrities to talk about how much they like to drink. It's the part you were born to play. All you have to do is smile and stay upright.

BoJack: I don't know. It sounds like a lot of work.

Princess Carolyn: You take up 80% of my time with your drama and make me 0% of my money. Do the damn commercial. Okay, I got to go. You're in charge, Todd. Keep this dummy out of trouble.

Todd: Hooray, responsibility.

BoJack: Hey. Do you really believe all that stuff you said to me earlier about me being smart and talented and good?

Princess Carolyn: BoJack, I'm an agent. I believe everything I say.

BoJack: Ah.

Todd: Hey, where the hell is that cheeseburger? I ordered it, like, an hour ago.

Princess Carolyn: Lenny Turteltaub, you skinny bitch. How the hell are you?

Lenny: I'm in a hurry, so I'll make this.. snappy. I got some great news about the picture we're putting together. I got..

Princess Carolyn: Sorry. Hello?

BoJack: Hey, I just wanted to thank you for getting me this job and pulling me out of that oh-so-predictably BoJack spiral of self-loathing and substance abuse. You really are the best.

Princess Carolyn: I know. Talk to you later.

BoJack: I feel like you see things in me that nobody else sees.

Princess Carolyn: Yep, I'm pretty great. Got to go.

BoJack: All this time, I never even..

Princess Carolyn: BoJack, I'm in a very important breakfast right now.

BoJack: Okay. I got to go, too.

Princess Carolyn: Sorry. What's the great news?

Lenny: We got Braff.

Princess Carolyn: You beautiful dickhead. You finally got Zach Braff? Ah, no other director has enough weight to handle a movie about the last days of Eva Braun.

Lenny: No shit, toots.

Waitress: Ooh, ooh, ooh. There you go.

Lenny: Thank you, sweetheart.

Princess Carolyn: Everything's coming together. With Braff directing, my client Cate Blanchett starring, and the great Lenny Turteltaub producing, this movie is a done deal.

Lenny: Look, honey, I been in this business a long time, okay? Long time. And as I once said to a young Ed Begley Sr., "It ain't a done deal till the deals are all done."

Princess Carolyn: I'm the best agent in the biz. I can seal these deals with my paws in my pants.

Lenny: Well, then I'll say to you what I once said to a young Buster Keaton, "What?"

    "VIGOR" 

Princess Carolyn: Laura! What's happening?

Laura: We're merging.

Princess Carolyn: No shit. With what?

Laura: FME. A bunch of people got laid off, and some of the FMEERS are already moving in. It's all so sudden and unexpected. It was not handled well.

Princess Carolyn: Oh, shit. Don't tell me one of the new agents is--

Laura: Vanessa Gekko.

Princess Carolyn: That slippery, slimy, cold-blooded, bug-eyed

Vanessa Gekko: What's new, pussycat?

Princess Carolyn: Gekko.

Vanessa: In the flesh.

Princess Carolyn: Ha ha. How are you?

Vanessa: What a morning, huh? I was in the middle of my second soul cycle class when I got the news. Can you imagine?

Princess Carolyn: No.

Vanessa: I was so excited, I rushed home, made love to my husband of 15 years, made a hot breakfast for my three wonderful girls, read to them, dropped them off at their elite private school, and then got my ass here as quick as I could. Um, how old are your kids now?

Princess Carolyn: I don't have any children.

Vanessa: Oh, well, it'll happen. You're still.. Anyway..

Mr. Witherspoon: Princess Carolyn. I see you've already met a new member of the team.

Vanessa: Vanessa Gekko, sir.

Mr. Witherspoon: I know that. This merger is very exciting.

Princess Carolyn: I'm pumped.

Vanessa: I'm beyond pumped.

Mr. Witherspoon: You should be, or at least I think you should be. It's hard to keep track of who's getting promoted - and who's getting fired.

Princess Carolyn: Oh.

Mr. Witherspoon: You're probably fine or not. Who knows?

Princess Carolyn: Ugh. What do you want, Todd?

Todd: Well, good news, bad news. The bad news is that there actually is no good news, and the other bad news is BoJack's gone.

Princess Carolyn: What? Where did he go? The shoot is at his house.

Todd: He just disappeared. I don't even know why he'd leave. This charcoal mellowed bourbon is so smooth, every time I take a sip, pure happiness.

Charlie: That was amazing.

Todd: Really?

Charlie: Can I get you to say that in a tuxedo?

Todd: Hey, I got to go. I think this is my big break. Don't worry. I won't let it get to my head or anything. Hey, who told that asshole he could sit in my chair?

Princess Carolyn: Don't forget I'm your agent, too! I want 10%.

BoJack: Hello, beautiful.

Princess Carolyn: What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be shooting a commercial.

BoJack: I know, but I was sitting there drinking bourbon and..

Princess Carolyn: They didn't give you fake bourbon on set?

BoJack: Oh, they did, and then I just mixed it with bourbon. And it hit me. Why was I so upset about Diane getting engaged? You're the one who's always been there for me, so I drank a lot more bourbon and drove over to tell you how I feel.

Princess Carolyn: Oh, I see what this is.

BoJack: Princess Carolyn, what are we doing? Clearly we're in love with each other.

Princess Carolyn: You're not in love with me. You're in love with Diane. And you're not even really in love with her. You just think you are because you pay her to listen to you talk about yourself.

BoJack: Diane getting engaged was the best thing that ever happened to me. It made me realize you're the one I need to be with.

Princess Carolyn: Ha! You say that every time something bad happens.

    FLASHBACKS 

BoJack: Not getting nominated for a People's Choice Award is the best thing that ever happened to me. It made me realize...

BoJack: .. Getting caught with that pound of cocaine was the best thing that ever happened to me.

BoJack: That hooker getting pregnant was the best thing that ever happened to me.

BoJack: Sneezing on Marisa Tomei was the best..

    NOW 

Princess Carolyn: Every time something bad happens, you come running to me for comfort. Well, it's not gonna happen this time. I can't be your agent and your girlfriend. It just doesn't work.

Laura: I have Lenny Turteltaub for you.

Princess Carolyn: I have to take this.

BoJack: Okay. But remember, I'm coming for you, and I'm gonna make you love me.

Princess Carolyn: Please don't. Hey.

Lenny: Bad news, P.C. Braff used your merger as an opportunity to jump ship.

Princess Carolyn: Aw, fish.

Lenny: Now his new agent's asking for twice the money. As I once said to a young Lionel Barrymore, "Eh, shut up."

Princess Carolyn: Without a director, Eva Braun is as dead as Eva Braun.

Lenny: Yep. You got to get someone big. What about those brothers

Princess Carolyn: Hello? Hello?

BoJack: Lady, you work too hard.

Princess Carolyn: That was an important phone call.

BoJack: Important phone call beep boop blorp.

Princess Carolyn: Don't you robot-voice me.

BoJack: Princess Carolyn, what are we doing?

Princess Carolyn: Well, I'm working, and you are leaving.

BoJack: Before I go, I got you a little sexy something to remember me by. Since we can't be together every second, which would be my preference, I give you cardboard BoJack. It's got a light-sensitive sound chip, so every time you walk by it, it quotes a line from Jerry Maguire, your favorite movie.

    'You complete me.' 

BoJack: What do you think? Pretty sweet, huh?

    'You had me at "hello." ' 

Princess Carolyn: I don't have time for you or cardboard you. I need to find a new director.

BoJack: Or you could find my nude erector.. She's gone.

    "ONE LUNCH MEETING LATER" 

Princess Carolyn: Blech. Word to the wise, Laura -- Do not pitch a Nazi romance to Steven Spielberg.

Laura: Just thought you should know there's been some reorganization -- vis-a-vis resource management.

Princess Carolyn: What are you saying?

Laura: You and Vanessa Gekko are sharing an office until they can find her a permanent one.

Princess Carolyn: The hell we are.

Laura: Also..

BoJack: Good news, Princess Carolyn. Vanessa's my agent now.

Princess Carolyn: What?

BoJack: You said you couldn't be my girlfriend and my agent, so I'm firing you. Now we can be in love.

Vanessa: Hope you like money, BoJack.

BoJack: This is so great. Now I can date you and have a better agent. Everybody wins.

Princess Carolyn: Oh.

BoJack: I'm a sporting agent.

Todd: Are you still searching for happiness? Make your own.. happiness. Mmm, that's some Guten Bourbon.

Charlie: Cut. That was great.

Todd: Was it? You know, I'm trying to do good work here, really find the character, but it's pretty distracting to have all these robots staring at me with their blinking red eyes.

Charlie: Those are cameras, Todd. We're making a commercial.

Todd: Oh, well, you want to make a good one? Then get them the hell out of here! I'm the face of this brand, I'm the man behind the thing, and I'm determined to get the jargon of this German bourbon blurbin'. Is it just me, or does this fake booze taste a lot like real booze?

Princess Carolyn: You want BoJack, you can have him. Here's a list of directors who won't work with him, studios that won't hire him, former assistants with restraining orders.

Vanessa: This is great. You know, it gets kind of boring when all your clients are in such demand, they practically find their own jobs.

Princess Carolyn: Well, then BoJack should be a lot of fun for you. No one wants to hire him.

(knock on the door)

Blue Jay: Hello. We're looking for BoJack Horseman's agent. We'd like to discuss a very lucrative business opportunity.

Princess Carolyn: You gotta be kidding me.

Vanessa: I'm BoJack's agent.

Robin: The opportunity is we're blackmailing you.

Princess Carolyn: Ha. All yours.

Blue Jay: Needless to say, it would be a shame if these pictures got out. Fortunately, that can easily be avoided {#PASS} by simply paying me and my partner here $150.

Robin: Each.

Vanessa: Let me just get my checkbook.

Princess Carolyn: Huh?

Robin: Whoa.

Vanessa: Oh, except California law prohibits taking photos on private property without a permit, but you had a permit, right?

Blue Jay: Uh

Robin: What's that?

Vanessa: Oh, also, extortion can be prosecuted as a class E felony. That's four years in prison, easy, and when you throw in the murder of Tupac Shakur

Robin: We didn't do that.

Blue Jay: Yeah, yeah. You can't pin that on us.

Vanessa: Well, someone's got to take the fall.

(Both gulp)

Robin: Sorry to bother you.

Blue Jay: Forget we were ever here.

Vanessa: That was fun. Hey, Laura, send those guys a nice fruit-and-nut basket.

Laura: You got it, boss.

Princess Carolyn: Who said you could use my assistant?

Mr.Witherspoon: I did.

Princess Carolyn: Oh, hello, Mr.Witherspoon.

Mr.Witherspoon: Did you know the human head weighs 8 pounds? Fascinating. So sorry we have to double up on everything while we work out who goes where and who gets fired, but in the meantime, help yourself to an intern, one of the rising stars at our company Charley Witherspoon.

Charley: Hello. I.. Oh. Sorry, my.. My hands are really sticky. Oh, God, am I blowing this?

Mr.Witherspoon: Charley was the editor of The Harvard Lampoon.

Vanessa: He can be Princess Carolyn's new assistant while I use Laura.

Princess Carolyn: Ugh.

Vanessa: Good thinking, boss.

Charley: Ah, ah, phone is ringing. Phone is ringing. What do I do? What do I do?

Princess Carolyn: I'll take it in here, Charlie. Hello.

Charlie: Princess Carolyn, your client is out of control.

Princess Carolyn: BoJack is not my client anymore.

Charlie: Not BoJack. Todd. I think someone mixed alcohol into his prop drink.

Todd: Oh, you pretenders. Bourbon is the name of a county. You can't just make bourbon in Germany. That would be like making Rice-A-Roni - anywhere but San Francisco.

Crue: No, no, no, no, no.

Princess Carolyn: Ugh. I'll be right there.

...........................

Todd: Ow.

Princess Carolyn: You got to get your shit together. You are a winner, okay? You are Todd.. Hold on. Fish. Okay, you are Todd goddamn.. What's your last name?

Todd: Chavez.

Princess Carolyn: Your last name is Chavez?

Todd: Yeah. Why?

Princess Carolyn: I don't know, I just never thought of you as a Chavez. Look, I got to go.

Todd: I feel like you didn't really finish the pep talk.

Princess Carolyn: I know, but I got a movie to put together. Best of luck.

Quentin Tarantulino: Ready for the tagline? Here's the tagline.

Princess Carolyn: What the heck is going on?

Quentin Tarantulino: "The woman who loved the man who hated everyone." That writes itself.

Princess Carolyn: You got to be kidding me.

Vanessa: Hey, where were you? We looked everywhere.

Princess Carolyn: You're having the Eva Braun meeting without me?

Vanessa: I'm so sorry, but I didn't know what the protocol was around here, and these guys were just champing at the bit. We're just wrapping up.

Princess Carolyn: But Cate is my client.

Vanessa: Okay, why don't I come to find you when it's over, and I'll bring you up to speed?

Princess Carolyn: Is that Quentin Tarantulino?

Vanessa: Yeah. I brought him on board. You know he's always wanted to direct a romantic comedy?

Princess Carolyn: Eva Braun is not a romantic comedy.

Vanessa: Bye.

    'We live in a cynical world, a cynical world.' 

BoJack: He's right, you know. Oh, ooh, oh, oh, over-rotate. Hey.

Princess Carolyn: I just missed an important meeting because I was babysitting Todd, who's too drunk to work because you switched out the prop bourbon with the real bourbon. You are ruining my life.

BoJack: Have dinner with me tonight.

Princess Carolyn: No way.

BoJack: Come on, just me, you, and a bottle of Pinot. Probably more than one bottle and some entrees. And I'll probably get an appetizer. I own the restaurant, so we can go crazy.

Princess Carolyn: I have to work.

BoJack: You don't have to work. You choose to work.

Princess Carolyn: Hmm.

BoJack: Why not choose to be happy for once?

Princess Carolyn: Mm.


BoJack: When you're writing a memoir, you spend a lot of time reflecting on the past. I regret not being a better friend to you and lover.

Princess Carolyn: Thank you. Lover's kind of a weird word, but thanks.

BoJack: You want to get out of this stuffy old restaurant, get some gelato, and maybe drive out to the ocean - and put our feet in the water?

Princess Carolyn: That sounds great. Let me just freshen up my whiskers.

BoJack: Great. I'll get the car and meet you outside. You scamper right back, pussycat. You look at your reflection too long, you might fall in love. She's gone.

Princess Carolyn: (phone) What do you want, Gekko?

Vanessa: Well, I was hoping to talk to you face-to-face, but I guess you had to leave work early.

Princess Carolyn: I left at 8:30. What is it?

Vanessa: Well, Cate and I had a really good talk today. We have so much in common, and especially since I'm doing so much for Eva Braun, it almost seemed weird that I wasn't repping her.

Princess Carolyn: No. No. No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

Vanessa: She and I are both high-powered working mothers, so I understand her priorities, so she's switching to Gekko. Wow, being a mom helped my career? I really can have it all.

Princess Carolyn: This isn't fair. I know everything about Cate. Her favorite color is red. Her favorite book is Suffragette City. Her favorite Spice Girl is Baby.

Vanessa: I know all I need to know, which is that she's beautiful, she's British, and she's gonna make me a lot of money.

Princess Carolyn: She's Australian, you moron.

Vanessa: If you need me, I'll be at work. Bye-e-e!

Princess Carolyn: Bye-e-e. Ugh.

Charley: Uh, telephone.

Princess Carolyn: Charley, get me Cate Blanchett.

Charley: Um, who is Okay, I don't Uh, uh, sorry, I can't.. Oh, sticky.

Princess Carolyn: You know what? Never mind. If Vanessa Gekko wants Cate that bad, she can have her. I'm gonna be okay. I'm gonna be happy. Tonight, I choose to be happy.

Charley: Hello? I think I put you on mute.

Princess Carolyn: Good night, Charley.

BoJack: Holy shit. Herb! How the hell are you, buddy?

Herb: Ruin' any lives lately?

BoJack: Excuse me?

Herb: I got your message, asshole. You got something to say to me, you come out to Malibu and say it to my face. I'll be alive tomorrow. After that, who knows?

Princess Carolyn: Sorry that took me so long. Just wanted to look my best for you, lover.

BoJack: Hey, um, I just got kind of a.. weird phone call.

Princess Carolyn: You and me both. Hey, screw 'em all, right?

BoJack: Yeah.

Princess Carolyn: Are we going to gelato?

BoJack: Princess Carolyn, what are we doing?

Princess Carolyn: Getting gelato?

BoJack: This was a mistake. I've been acting crazy. That phone call just pulled me back to reality. You were right. I don't love you. You don't love me. We're just two lonely people trying to hate ourselves a little less. Maybe that's all we're ever gonna be. Maybe that's all we ever were.

Princess Carolyn: Well, this night took a turn. You know the worst part? I knew this was gonna happen and I let myself get excited anyway.

BoJack: So we agree that this is on you, then? I guess I'll see you around.

Princess Carolyn: You're not even gonna give me a ride home?

BoJack: Sorry, I think I just need to be alone right now.

Princess Carolyn: Of course, of course. That's what you get when you fall for a horse. Taxi!

Princess Carolyn: You got to get your shit together. So yesterday, you let yourself fall in love a little bit, and you got your heart broken. Serves you right for having feelings. Starting now, you are a hard, heartless career gal. Go to work, be awesome at it, and don't waste time on foolish flights of fancy. From now on, you are a robot. Beep bop boop blurp bleep.

BoJack: Hello.

Princess Carolyn: I just want you to know {that} I'm fine.

BoJack: Uh-oh. People only say they're fine when they're not fine. Did I hurt your feelings last night?

Princess Carolyn: I'm an agent. I don't have feelings.

BoJack: Well, I'm glad you called. I think that you had the right idea yesterday. I should be getting back to work. Can you get me another job?

Princess Carolyn: Yeah, well, I'm not your agent anymore, so, no.

BoJack: Oh, right. Well, just tell whoever, then. Haah!!

Woman: Whoa. Asshole!

BoJack: Anyway, I'm off to Malibu to see Herb Kazzaz. He has cancer, which, as you know, is a whole thing. Plus, he hates me, so I could really use some good news at the end of the day.

Princess Carolyn: Oh, my God, you're going to see Herb? You must be really.. Nope, don't care. Not interested. Hope you like kicking ass, Charlie, because that's all we're gonna do today.

Charley: My tie got stuck in the copier this morning.

Princess Carolyn: That's great, Charlie.

Charley: If you flip them real quick, it looks like the tie is running.

Princess Carolyn: Hey, Vanessa, your client, BoJack Horseman, wants a job. Good luck.

Vanessa: Oh, yeah, about that. Gwyneth came in this morning, and I wanted to show her that she was a top priority, so I shredded BoJack's contract right in front of her. Heh heh

Princess Carolyn: What? You just signed BoJack yesterday.

Mr: I say good riddance to Mr... Houseman or whatever that horse's name is. It's not like he makes this company any money, and he does seem to take up an awful lot of your time.

    ' I'm from Arizona, Jerry. I went to Arizona State. Todd, how do I turn this thing off? Todd. 

    Todd: What? I'm busy. 

    'Never mind. Think I've figured it out. Now that I've got the room to myself, time to practice the trombone. 

Princess Carolyn: He's kind of in a bad place right now. You can't just drop him.

Mr. Witherspoon: The best agent in this building couldn't get that guy a job.

Princess Carolyn: The best agent in this building got him a job yesterday, and I could get him a feature by the end of today.

Mr. Witherspoon: If you want to get him a movie by the end of the day, great, do that. Otherwise, we are washing our hands of him. Charley, I hear NBC picked up your running tie show. Congratulations.

Charley: Thank you, Dad.

Princess Carolyn: Hey, Marty, Princess Carolyn here. How'd you like to work with the BoJack Horseman? What's that? You hate his guts? What's that? He's a talentless Boob? What's that? You'll never work with BoJack again? What's that? You want him to die in an ass factory warehouse fire, smothering to death under a pile of burning asses? Well, if you change your mind, give me a call. Oh, BoJack, what am I gonna do with you?

Vanessa: I don't understand why you're going through all this trouble for him. That guy's dead weight, Princess Carolyn. If you don't cut him loose, you're never gonna be happy.

    ' Help me help you.' 

Princess Carolyn: That's it. Of course.

"SILVER SPOON"

Princess Carolyn: Cameron Crow, you skinny bitch. You know Jerry Maguire's my favorite movie of all time? All your films are so human, which is super impressive since you're a crow.

Cameron Crow: Well, my name is Cameron Crow, but I'm actually a raven, so common misconception.

Princess Carolyn: Well, whatever you are

Cameron Crow: A raven.

Princess Carolyn: I brought you this

Cameron Crow: Suffragette City "a coming of age story about rock music, being a teenager in the '80s and buying zoos"? How have I not heard of this book?

Princess Carolyn: You'd be the perfect director to make a movie out of it, and I happen to know this is Cate Blanchett's favorite book. I'll bet she'll drop everything to play the part. You should give her a caw...

Cameron Crow: Okay, I see.. Yeah. Caw is what crows say. Again, I am not a crow.

Vanessa: Cate, listen to me, you're making a big mistake. Eva Braun is your dream, remember? Cate? Hello? Cate!

Princess Carolyn: Oh, no. What happened? Did Cate drop out of your little Holocaust movie so she could make my little Cameron Crow movie? Why don't you go home and cry about it to your loving husband and children?

Mr. Witherspoon: Say, which one of you is overseeing the Eva Braun package?

Vanessa: That would be me, sir.

Mr. Witherspoon: Vanessa, you really shat the bed on this one. Now, are you fired? Not exactly. Can you still work here? No.

Laura: Lenny Turteltaub here to see you.

Princess Carolyn: Thanks, Laura.

Lenny: So, one minute I'm making a movie with Cate Blanchett. Next, I hear she's doing a picture with Cameron Crow about mix tapes. As I said to Ed Porter at the premiere of The Great Train Robbery, "Aah, the train's coming right at me." What the hell is going on?

Princess Carolyn: I don't know, Lenny. Eva Braun was Vanessa's project.

Lenny: All that work for nothing. Now Quentin Tarantulino's got four arms up my ass 'cause he got all excited about making a rom-com.

Princess Carolyn: You know what would be a great romantic comedy? Remember when that guy stole the D from the Hollywood sign so he could propose to his girlfriend?

Lenny: That would make a great movie, but who would play the lead, huh? Preferably someone kind of washed up. You know how much Quentin loves to revitalize dead careers. It's kind of his thing.

Princess Carolyn: Well, in that case, you know who'd be great?

    ' Show me the money.' 

BoJack: Yeah.

Princess Carolyn: Good news. You're back in my stable, and I got you the lead in a romantic comedy. Who's the best agent in the world?

BoJack: What?

Princess Carolyn: I went through hell and back today, but it was worth it because I got you a job. Aren't you excited?

BoJack: No. I don't know. I don't care about that.

Princess Carolyn: You.. You said you wanted a job.

BoJack: It doesn't matter. Nothing matters.

Princess Carolyn: Wow. What happened in Malibu?

BoJack: I got to go.

Laura: Need anything else?

Princess Carolyn: No, thanks, Laura. Go home. I'll see you tomorrow.

Laura: Are you gonna head out soon?

Princess Carolyn: Where else would I go?

Phone: Happy birthday, Princess Carolyn.

Princess Carolyn: Thanks, phone.

Phone: You are 40.


BoJack: (on the phone) Oh, right. Well, just tell whoever, then. Haa-aah!

(tires screech)

Pedestrian: Ooh!

(BoJack honks horn)

Pedestrian: Asshole!

(tires squeal)

BoJack: Anyway, I'm off to Malibu to see Herb Kazzaz. He has cancer, which, as you know, is a whole thing. Plus, he hates me, so I could really use some good news at the end of the day.

Princess Carolyn: Oh, my God. You're going to see Herb? You must be reall—Nope. Don't care. Not interested.

    (phone beeps) 

BoJack: Okay, Good talk.

Diane: Hey. You ready for this?

BoJack: Listen. I want to make sure I don't spend any time alone with Herb. I'm bringing you along as my buffer.

Diane: And your memoirist. I should meet your old best friend before he dies of cancer.

BoJack: Fine, I guess. Just don't abandon me. No bathroom breaks. And don't slip out of the room to text your fiancé a bunch of winky smileys with hearts next to them—Gross. Congratulations on the whole being engaged thing, by the way.

Diane: Thanks. It's just starting to hit me. I'm getting married. Thank God I don't have to die alone. No offense.

BoJack: None taken. 'Till you said, "No offense."

Diane: So what's the deal with you and this guy? You never talk about him.

BoJack: Well, I kind of, maybe stabbed him in the back. Yeah, it's a bit of a story. A story of power, betrayal, and ambitious hairstyles. The year? 198..

Todd: Movie's over.

BoJack: Watch the next one.

Todd: Aw, I'm tired of watching movies. Do you want to play a game?

BoJack: Sure. I spy with my little eye someone who needs to shut the hell up.

Todd: Is it me?

BoJack: It's always you. Now, where was I?

Diane: You were about to tell a story about you being a shitty friend, but then, we got interrupted by you yelling at Todd.

BoJack: Oh, yeah. Shut up, Todd.

    '80s music 
    "Generic '80s new wave" 
    "Beep, bop, beep, bop, beep, bop" 
    "This is a song from the '80s" 
    "The decade which it currently is" 

Herb: (performs) Why do we need a kitchen and a bathroom? Pipes are pipes, people. Do we really need a toilet and a sink and a bathtub and—Wait, hold on—A whole 'nother room with another sink? They're all just holes to the ocean, lady. I mean, come on.

BoJack: (laughs)

Charlotte: BoJack, you're late. Here. I got you a beer. It's on the house. Don't tell my boss.

BoJack: Thanks, Charlotte, but one beer gets me tipsy. I got to be clear-headed for my set. Looks like Herb's killing.

Charlotte: Yeah, and the suits from ABC are here.

    (laughter) 

Charlotte: Look. They're nodding. That's the executive version of laughing.

BoJack: Wow. They must be serious about Herb. That's Angela Diaz. She's the woman who made pantsuits a thing.

Charlotte: Oh, before I forget. Herb and I are gonna see Back to the Future again this weekend. Want to come?

BoJack: I'm in. That movie was amazing, except for all the lame time period jokes. We get it. The '50s were different. I'll have a New Coke, please. Listen, you guys don't need to include me on your dates. Sometimes, it makes me feel like a third wheel.

Charlotte: BoJack, stop. Without the third wheel, how would you ride a tricycle?

BoJack: Wouldn't that make it a bicycle?

Bubbles: Herb Kazzaz, ladies and gentlemen.

    (applause) 

Herb: Hey-ooh!

BoJack: Great set, man. It's like everything you said was something I've thought before but never had the balls to say.

Herb: Thanks, BJ. I set 'em up. Now, you knock 'em down.

Bubbles: Let's give it up for BoJack Horseman.

    (applause) 

BoJack: Well, thank you, Bubbles. I love L.A. Don't you guys? The prettiest girls in the world flock to this city, and they end up with total knobs. Take this couple, for example.

    (laughter) 

BoJack: Excuse me, miss. Is that your date?

Woman: He's my husband.

BoJack: That's your husband? You can do better. Give me a call after the show.

    (laughter) 

BoJack: I'm just kidding around. (whispers) I'm not kidding around.

    (laughter) 

BoJack: Ugh. Maker's Manhattan? 2:00 P.M.? Not judging. That guy tipped me a quarter. That's barely enough money to buy three gallons of gas.

Herb: You want a slug?

BoJack: No, I got to stay sharp. I got another audition this afternoon. God, I can't wait till I'm finally up for real jobs instead of these dumb commercials. "Here's the thing about most long-distance plans."

Herb: Ugh. I hate when people say that. "Here's the thing."

BoJack: It's so stupid.

Herb: Just say the thing. You don't need to introduce the concept that there's going to be a thing.

BoJack: I don't expect to be offered Secretariat right away, but when am I gonna be up for real roles?

Herb: We'll get there, BJ. We both will. In fact, if I play my cards right, I might get there real soon.

BoJack: Wait. Did the guys from ABC call?

Herb: Uh-huh. They invited me to some hotshot event at LACMA this weekend. I'm gonna pitch 'em a TV show while they're drunk.

BoJack: An off-the-clock, non-work-related social event? That's the perfect time to pitch a TV show. You're brilliant.

    LACMA 

Charlotte: These people are so fancy.

Herb: Look, look, look. Hey, hey, look. That's Joyce DeWitt, isn't it? That's Joyce DeWitt. And that's Angela Diaz.

Charlotte: And that's Ubu, the guy who sits.

Herb: He is a good dog.

    (Ubu barks) 

BoJack: Guys, don't take your eyes off the prize. We need to fill Charlotte's bag with these mini quiches. This is our breakfast for June.

Man: Herb Kazzaz.

BoJack: Shit, we're busted. (plate shatters) Pretend you don't speak English.

Charlotte: Buongiorno. Bon Jovi.

BoJack: Salutations. Crap, that's English.

Man: Hey, you mind if I steal this superstar for a second?

Herb: Okay, yeah. I'll catch you two later. Stay out of trouble. Oh, ho.

BoJack: Well, there he goes. Herb's about to hit the big time, and I'm just gonna be a small-fry doing tiny commercials and eating mini quiches.

Charlotte: You're dead wrong. You're gonna be a big success. Herb says that to me all the time. He thinks the world of you.

BoJack: He does?

Charlotte: Yeah, I'm not worried about if you'll become a star. I'm more worried about how you'll change when it happens.

BoJack: Like, you think I'll get fat?

Charlotte: No, that's not what I'm talking about.

BoJack: So you're saying I definitely won't get fat?

Charlotte: No.

BoJack: Well, make up your mind, lady.

Charlotte: Look over there. See those tar pits? Hollywood's a really pretty town that's smack on top of all that black tar. By the time you realize you're sinking, it's too late.

BoJack: Wait, is this a science lesson?

Charlotte: No, BoJack, it's a metaphor.

BoJack: Ugh, that's worse.

Charlotte: BoJack, I'm moving to Maine.

BoJack: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Really? Does Herb know?

Charlotte: Yeah. I don't think I'm the person Herb's looking for.

BoJack: I'm going to miss you, Charlotte.

Charlotte: Hey, do you ever wonder what would have happened if you'd met me before Herb did? Would you have made a move on me?

BoJack: Charlotte

Charlotte: I don't think you would have. You know why? I think you're a coward. Now go stuff some prosciutto in your pants before that Webster kid takes it all.

    (upbeat music) 

Herb: I love this town.

BoJack: Why did you bring me to Griffith Park? Are we gonna get in a knife fight like in Rebel Without a Cause?

Herb: I hate that title.

BoJack: He had several causes.

Herb: I wanted to give you this. Look out at that city. What do you see?

BoJack: Wow, I didn't realize there were so many day hookers.

Herb: I see a city that you and I will run someday, and when we're both famous and have everything we've ever wanted, we'll come back here together and high five.

BoJack: I'm not fully on board with this new high five thing. Whatever happened to the low five? Give me some skin.

Herb: BJ, listen. I got a call from ABC today. They bought my TV pitch.

BoJack: What? That's amazing. What's the show?

Herb: It's called Horsin' Around.

BoJack: Well, good luck on your rocket ship to the top without me.

Herb: No, BoJack, the show's about a horse, and I told those suits if they want my show, then that horse is gonna be BJ Goddamn Horseman.

BoJack: Oh, my God.

Herb: And they said, "No."

BoJack: Oh.

Herb: And I said, "Please?" And they said, "Okay." So, what do you say? Want to be my star?

BoJack: Seriously? Of course, I do. Of course, Herb. Jesus Christ, thank you.

BOTH: Mm-hmm

BoJack: Whoa, whoa. I think you got the wrong idea here.

Herb: Yeah, no, man.

BoJack: Whoa. Herb, I'm not

Herb: Me either. No, I just You know, I caught up in the moment.

BoJack: Yeah, no, I gotcha.

Herb: BJ, can you believe it? We're gonna make an actual TV show! One that takes an unflinching look at the gritty reality of the American family. Just kidding. Let's get rich!

Both: Yeah.

    (rock music) 

BoJack: (sings) Generic '90s grunge song; Everyone in flannel; Generic '90s grunge song; Something from Seattle

BoJack: Why would I say, "You'll never get me in that sweater" in this scene and then, in the very next scene, I'm wearing the sweater? Did my character suddenly forget that he didn't want to wear a sweater?

Writer: No, see, that's actually the joke.

BoJack: Don't explain the joke to me. I just don't understand how it's a joke.

Writer: So you do want me to explain it to you?

BoJack: I want you to add a scene showing how I changed my mind about the sweater so the goddamn episode makes sense. Look at me, doing your job for you. Way to go, Shakespeare.

Herb: BJ, you're doing the scene as written.

BoJack: What happened to the stories I requested? Where's my rap? You said you'd write me a rap.

Herb: We're working on it. We just need a rhyme for "and I'm here to say."

BoJack: Well, what about giving me Rollerblades? How are people gonna know that my character is hip if he doesn't roll the blade?

Herb: Just get out there and do your job. Every one of your ideas is stupid or racist.

BoJack: That was one pitch, and I didn't say they're all thieves. But if you're too scared to start a national dialogue, maybe I'll take my ideas home. Good luck making Horsin' Around without the horse.

Sharona: BoJack, hon. That audience out there traveled from all over the country just to taste some of your magic. Do you really want to disappoint them?

BoJack: (sighs) Okay, Sharona. I'll go out and jerk this limp script until it gets hard, but I'm not doing it for Herb. I'm doing it for the fans.

Herb: And your 30K an episode.

Announcer: Let's give it up for BoJack Horseman!

BoJack: And there better be some Zimas in my dressing room after the show. (cheers and applause) Wait a minute. This isn't the bar. I got to fire my assistant. (laughter) You guys sound like you're ready for a show.

(rock music)

BoJack: Oh, gross. Why do I keep trying to like Zima? (phone rings) Talk to me, world.

Princess Carolyn: BoJack, it's Princess Carolyn. How are you doing today?

BoJack: Well, I'll tell you my problem. I just keep getting handsomer.

Princess Carolyn: (laughs) Good problems to have. Hold for a sec. I've got your agent on the line.

Marv: BoJack Goddamn Horseface. I got some news so good, you'll goddamn kiss me. Put it here. Put it here. What's the role you've been dying to play your whole life, besides Kathy Ireland's bathing suit?

BoJack: Ha-ha. She is attractive.

Marv: Good God, when I die, bury me in Kathy Ireland.

BoJack: Uh, Marv? Marv? What's the big news?

Marv: Secretariat! It's happening, and it's down to you and Val Kilmer for the title role.

BoJack: That's amazing. Thank you. Thank you.

Marv: Now, listen. I don't want to see you in any more tabloids. Keep your head down and your nose clean. Now, I gotta go. I got lunch with MC Skat Kat.

    TV 

Tom Jumbo-Grumbo: Scandal breaking today surrounding the family sitcom, Horsin' Around.

BoJack: Oh, God. What did I do this time?

Tom: Herb Kazzaz, the show's creator, was caught tonight in an LAPD sting on public indecency.

BoJack: Wha'?

    "Kazzaz Kazzaztrophe" 

Tom: Police say Mr.Kazzaz was caught in the middle of lewd acts with another man. Conservative groups have been quick to organize.

Man: Horsin' Around is a show for kids. My family should be able to watch those nubile preteens without men like perv Kazzaz flaunting their alternative lifestyles and ruining America.

BoJack: Sheei-i-it.

Herb: BoJack, I gotta tell ya'. I'm gay.

BoJack: No doy.

Herb: I know we haven't been—close for the past couple years.

BoJack: Okay, I'm gonna hold back my "No doys" because there might be a lot.

Herb: But you know me, right? You know that I'm a good guy. They're gunning for me at the network, and if I get kicked off this, I won't recover. I need to know that you've got my back. If you threaten to walk, they'll listen to you.

BoJack: Herb, you picked the worst possible time to

Herb: Hey, you know I wouldn't ask if I didn't need it. Come on, BoJack. How'd we get so far apart, huh?

BoJack: (sighs) You know what? You can count on me, Herb. I mean, I wouldn't even be here if it weren't for you.

Herb: I knew it! I knew you'd come through. And when this is all over, we're going to drive back up to Griffith Park. I still owe you that high five, right?

BoJack: Hey, this is a dumb question, but do you guys ever, like, all link up together and do, like, a party train or a fun circle? 'Cause I feel like I'd be doing that all the—Never mind. Stupid question. Feel stupid for asking that.

    (crowd shouting) 

Guard: (barking) Go right ahead.

Herb: And then it goes, "I like healthy gums in a major way."

BoJack: See, that's what I'm talking about. That's great. We just gotta make sure that we work in the phrase "toothbrush rap" early, so they know I'm rapping.

Angela Diaz: BoJack, can we chat for a second?

Herb: Ugh. Here we go. It's the big one.

Angela Diaz: I'm not gonna waste your time with small talk because you work for me, and your time is my time. We're letting Herb go.

(Together, in unison:) BoJack: You can't do that. Angela: "I can't do that."

Angela Diaz: I'm not asking you. It's nothing personal. I like Herb. I think he's a good guy. But this is a business, and every day we don't fire him, we're flushing money down the crapper.

(Together, in unison:) BoJack: Well, if he goes, I go. Angela: "Well, if he goes, you go."

Angela Diaz: I wouldn't do that. BoJack, I think you're a star, and sometimes being a star means making tough choices. You can storm out, make a big show out of what a "good" friend you are, or you could be the guy who does his job.

BoJack: Angela—

Angela Diaz: I'll tell you when it's your turn to talk again. Look, you're a star, but this is really just the beginning of the BoJack Horseman story. You can choose whatever path you want, but I'll tell you right now. You don't win awards and you don't get to be on the covers of magazines and you don't get to play the lead role in the Secretariat movie by being a good friend. What's that old expression about how the show must go on? Oh, right. It's "Don't be an idiot."

So what do you think, BoJack? That's a courtesy question. I already know what you think because I have conversations like this one five times a day. I know who you are, and I know you've already made your decision. But if you want to surprise me, now's the time to do it. That's what I thought. You're doing the right thing. I know it's hard. But if Herb's really your friend, he'll understand. Now, you've got a show to put on, so I'll let you get ready. This was a good conversation. Productive. If you're lucky, I'll never talk to you again. (cup thuds)

BoJack: (sighs)

Announcer: You folks ready for a show? (audience cheering) 'Cause I think a certain someone might show up any second. (applause)

BoJack: (sighs)

    (cheers and applause) 

BoJack: Wait a minute. This isn't the bar. I gotta fire my assistant.

    (laughter)

Diane: So what ended up happening with Secretariat?

BoJack: Went into turnaround. I don't totally know what "turnaround" means, but they never made the movie.

Todd: Whoa. This house is way bigger than yours. Herb's done really well for a guy you dicked over. Oh, no. Ah!

BoJack: That's enough out of you. Stay out here and turn this car around in case we need to leave in a hurry.

Todd: Hooray! A task.

    (doorbell rings) 

BoJack: (sighs)

Herb: (coughs) BoJack! Well. Jesus, you look shitty. Have you been eating your guilt this whole time?

    (all laugh uncomfortably) 

BoJack: Yeah, you don't look so hot yourself, Herb.

Herb: I have cancer. And hello. Who's this stunning creature? And what string of bad decisions has placed you in BoJack's orbit?

Diane: Uh..

BoJack: This is Diane. She's writing a book about me.

Diane: Pleasure to meet you.

Herb: Is your book called, "Portrait of an Asshole?" (laughs) I kid'. It's funny because he ruined my life. I joke. It's what I do. Please, come in. You're letting out all the cancer. Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

BoJack: (forced laugh) Ha ha

Todd: Almost. Ah.. Almost there. Come on ah.

Herb: Oh, thanks. Thanks.

Tina: (growls)

Herb: BoJack, how are your utensils?

BoJack: Uh, they're fine.

Herb: Are you sure? Because if that knife ain't sharp enough, I got another that you left in my back 20 years ago. (laughs)

BoJack: Could have seen that coming. Who asks about utensils?

Diane: I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

BoJack: Nope. No, you are not.


Todd:(in a car) Uh. Oh. Ow. Almost.

    (exciting music) 

Cammie: (with a gun) Drive, drive, drive!

Todd: Oh. Oh, no. I can't turn the car around. I've been trying to do this three-point turn forever. I mean, it's more like a 300-point turn. Am I right, huh?

Kenzie: Hee hee hee hee!

Cammie: Hey, we've got two sacks of Kardashian swag and the fuzz on our heels. You think this is Driver's Ed, you hat-wearing pussy? Drive the goddamn car!

Herb: (coughs)

Diane: Hey, Herb, is that your Vitamix? BoJack has one, too. I wonder if you guys have.. strong opinions about it one way or the other.

Herb: Well, the stupid thing was like 600 bucks.

BoJack: I have used mine a grand total of zero times.

Herb: I got it a month before I was diagnosed with cancer. I don't give a shit about being healthy anymore.

BoJack: I don't even have cancer, and I don't use it.

Herb: So who's it for?

BoJack: Exactly. What is so great about liquids? Every article I read now is "juice this" and "juice that."

Herb: You know why? Juice controls the media.

BoJack: Hey-ooh.

    (both laugh) 


    (in a car) 

Cammie: Can't this thing go any faster?

Todd: Uh, I'm going as fast as I can!

    (tires squealing) 

Kenzie: Do you want me to get out? Try to guide you?

Todd: No, I think I'm almost there.

Kenzie: You're doing a great job.

Cammie: Kenzie, stop talking to him.

Kenzie: Why? He's being nice.

Cammie: Remember the number one rule of the Celebrity Stealing Club: "No falling in love."

Kenzie: Ugh. That's your rule for every club.

Cammie: It's a good rule.

Todd: Whoa. Whoa, guys. I'm sensing a lot of hostility here. Maybe we should take our masks off and actually talk.

Cammie: You want me to take my mask off? Fine. Happy? I took my mask off.

Todd: Did you? Because I think you're still wearing a mask.

    (both girls in realization) Oh. 

Diane: Oh, my God, Herb, you met President Clinton?

Herb: Oh, yeah. Many times. Did you think that I spent the last 20 years on my couch just feeling sorry for myself? I mean, I did do that, but I also started (coughs) a charity to bring clean water to millions of children in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Diane: Oh, wow.

BoJack: I presented at the Teen Choice Awards. Wait, is that Charlotte?

Herb: Yeah, yeah. We kept in touch. You should actually give her a call. I'm sure she'd love to hear from you.

BoJack: She looks good for someone so old.

Herb: She's three years younger than you.

BoJack: Exactly!

Herb: (laughs, coughs)

Tina: Er?

Herb: Well, guys, I'm pretty beat. I think I need to head off to bed, and I hope I actually wake up later. (coughs) And it was actually nice to see you, BoJack. You can see yourselves out. (chuckling) "Juice controls the media." (chuckling) I love it.

Cammie: So I guess in a sense I'm running away from the cops, but I feel like in another, truer sense, I'm running away from myself.

Todd: Truth. Truth.

Cammie: Whoa.

Todd: Kenzie, do you have anything to share?

Kenzie: Just how amazing it feels to finally be honest for once. I could live a million lives, and I'd never forget this one afternoon.

Todd: Word. You know, I act all cool and sophisticated on the outside, but on the inside, I'm just Todd, you know? But thanks to you guys, I think I'm finally ready to let my guard down.

Cammie: Do you hear that?

Kenzie: He's letting his guard down. Let's get him!

Todd: (grunts) Oh!

Both Girls: Celebrity Stealing Club strikes again!

BoJack: This.. This just doesn't feel right. I should have brought a bottle of wine. That's what adults do. BoJack, damn it.

Diane: Is that what's bothering you, that you didn't bring wine?

BoJack: You're right. I just would have drunk it on the way here.

Diane: This isn't about wine, BoJack. If you have something you need to say to someone, you should do it while you have the chance because before you know it, it'll be too late.

BoJack: Is this one of those things where we're talking about Herb but we're actually talking about something else?

Diane: No, I was talking about Herb.

BoJack: Okay, good. Yeah, me, too.

BoJack: (cheerfully) Hey, buddy!

Herb: You come back for that Vitamix, you (coughs)

BoJack: Ooh, you should get that looked at.

Herb: Yeah. I've been meaning to see a doctor.

BoJack: Hey, I wanted to talk to you about.. you know. I feel bad about what happened.

Herb: So you're apologizing.

BoJack: Yes. I'm sorry.

Herb: Okay. I don't forgive you.

BoJack: Herb, I said I'm sorry.

Herb: Yeah, and I do not forgive you.

BoJack: Uh-- not sure you get what's happening here. This could be the last time that you--

Herb: No. I'm not gonna give you closure. You don't get that. (coughs) You have to live with the shitty thing you did for the rest of your life. You have to know that it's never, ever going to be okay.

BoJack: I really think that we'd both feel better if we just--

Herb: I'm dying. I'm not gonna feel better, and I'm not gonna be your prop so you can feel better.

BoJack: You have to believe me. I did everything I could.

Herb: Yeah? Then why didn't you call me? Huh? 20 years you didn't call me.

BoJack: Look, I—I wanted to, but I didn't think—

Herb: You know what it was like for me? I had nobody. Everybody left. I knew all those showbiz phonies would turn on me. Sure. But you?

BoJack: It's not my fault you got fired.

Herb: I don't care about the job! I did fine. I had a good life. But what I needed then was a friend, and you abandoned me. And I will never forgive you for that. Now, get the fuck out of my house.

BoJack: I (sighs) Hey, this is a dumb question, but the gay thing and the rectal cancer thing aren't related, are they?

Herb: Get out of here!!

BoJack: Never mind. Stupid question. Forget I brought it up. -- Huh.

Herb: Hey, BJ. Put that back, asshole!

BoJack: No, you gave this to me.

Herb: (growls)

BoJack: No!

    (both grunting) 

Diane: BoJack?! What are you doing?! Get off him!

Herb: The show was never the same after I left. Admit it!

BoJack: Some people prefer the later years.

Tina: (growling)

Diane: BoJack. Come on.

BoJack: (panting)

Diane: Thank you for inviting us. You have a lovely home.

Herb: You know what your problem is? You want to think of yourself as the good guy. Well, I know you better than anyone, and I can tell you—that you're not! In fact, you'd probably sleep a lot better at night if you just admitted to yourself that you're a selfish goddamn coward who takes whatever he wants and doesn't give a shit about who he hurts. That's you. That's BoJack Horseman.

BoJack: I don't know why I came here.

Herb: Yeah. You do.

    (engine revs, tires screech) 

Princess Carolyn: (on the phone) You said you wanted a job.

BoJack: It doesn't matter. Nothing matters.

Princess Carolyn: Wow. What happened in Malibu?

BoJack: I gotta go.

    (phone beeps) 

Diane: Hey, bright side. At least now you have a good story to tell—at his funeral.

BoJack: Ugh, God.

Diane: I'm not trying to kill the vibe here, but I've had to pee for, like, three hours.

BoJack: (sighs)

Diane: Look, I won't put what happened today in the book if you don't want me to.

BoJack: No, it's okay. Full truth like we agreed. Warts and all. It doesn't matter anyway. I don't even care what anybody thinks anymore.

Diane: Well, for what it's worth, I think it took a lot of guts to do what you did back there.

    (water lapping) 

(BoJack tries to kiss Diane)

BoJack: Mmm

(Diane pushing him away, shaking her head)

Diane: Mm! 

BoJack: (clears his throat)

Diane: So should we talk about how you just tried to kiss me?

BoJack: No, I don't think we need to talk about that.

Diane: Yeah, you're right. What's to talk about, right? We're f-friends, right?

BoJack: Oh, yeah, totally.

Diane: Yeah, friends. And I think it's important that we stay friends.

BoJack: Yeah, I agree.

Diane: And be friends with each other.

BoJack: Yeah, friends.

Diane: And also to each other.

BoJack: Plus, hey, you're getting married.

Diane: That's right. Next summer. Nantucket is great in the summer. Not like L.A., which is so hot and dry.

BoJack: It is arid.

Diane: Well see you later!

BoJack: We're still a few miles—

Diane: I'll walk. It's a beautiful night. Ah! Sorry, sorry!

BoJack: Shit. Todd, we gotta stop this wedding. Todd? Aw, crap. I left him in Malibu.

"BELLICAN'S", SUNDAY

Todd: But wait, doesn't Diane want to marry Mr. Peanutbutter?

BoJack: No, see, she thinks she does, but she actually doesn't. That's why we need to be good friends right now, and put our own feelings aside and sabotage our friend's engagement.

Todd: Oh— Wait? What?

Princess Carolyn: Oh. I got here as soon as I could. What's the emergency?

BoJack: We got to figure out a way to stop Diane's wedding.

Princess Carolyn: Hm. Okay. So when you woke me up in the middle of the night and told me to rush over here because of an "emergency," the emergency you were referring to was Diane getting married a year from now?

BoJack: Yeah, you got any ideas?

Princess Carolyn: I'm done. I'm not going to waste another thought on you. I am at a bar. It's the weekend. I'm gonna enjoy myself.

BoJack: Look, if you don't have any ideas, just say you don't have any ideas.

Princess Carolyn: Yoo-hoo! Buy me a drink.

Vincent Adult Man: Uh, okay.

Princess Carolyn: What's your name, stud?

Vincent: Vincent. Adult man. Vincent Adultman.

Princess Carolyn: Ya' hear that, BoJack? Vincent is an adult, and I'll bet he knows how to treat a lady.

BoJack: He very clearly isn't and doesn't.

Vincent: Would you like alcohol?

Princess Carolyn: I certainly would, you sophisticated smooth talker. Mmm! Tell me all about you.

Vincent: Mm.. I like business—transactions.

BoJack: Are you seriously trying to make me jealous by flirting with what is very obviously just three kids stacked on top of each other under a trench coat?

Princess Carolyn: Vinnie, what does a guy like you do for fun?

BoJack: I don't have time for these shenanigans. I got a wedding to shanghai. Good luck with your business transactions.

Vincent: Thanks.

Todd: Ugh!

MONDAY

Mr. Peanutbutter: Officer. The mail truck pulled up right next to me. I got a bad vibe. What was I supposed to do? Not chase the mail truck?

Fuzzyface: Mr. Peanutbutter, I'm a big fan, so I'm gonna let you off with a warning this time.

    "Dangerous—Come on—Dangerous" 

Mr. Peanutbutter: Aah!

Fuzzyface: Mr. Peanutbutter!

Mr. Peanutbutter: Hey, honeysuckle. Great news. I got to ride in a police car. Bad news I lost my driver's license.

Diane: Let me guess. Were you chasing the mailman again?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Yeah, why? Did you see him out there too? Nothing stops them. Not rain, not sleet, not dead of night, not gates! Anyway, I need a little favor. Can you drive me everywhere I need to go for the next three months?

Diane: I really can't, sweetheart. I'm super busy.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Oh, you're working on our wedding registry.

Diane: I'm writing my book.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Right. But don't forget about the registry.

Diane: Mr. Peanutbutter, you know I love you. And you know I am really excited about getting married, but right now I'm working, and I have a lot of thoughts in my head, and I can't really think about our wedding or the future or me being married to you.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Okay. What's going on? Talk to me like I'm Michelle Pfeiffer in the Coolio video. Just Well, um with the leg-- Hmm, all right. And Coolio.

Diane: Nothing's going on. It's just that this wedding is kind of starting to feel like a lot.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Honey, relax. Getting married is easy. I mean, I've already done it twice.

Diane: It's fine. I'm sorry. I just need to focus on the book right now.

Mr. Peanutbutter: So that's still "a no" on driving me around?

Diane: Why don't you hire a driver?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Eh-eh-eh-deh Is there a light bulb above my head? Because while you were talking, I just got an amazing idea. I should hire a driver! Oh, this will be a romp. If I know me, this will be a romp.

Todd: I'm not sure how I feel about breaking and entering, BoJack.

BoJack: Well, that's the beauty part. The B&E is really the least illegal piece of this 12-point master plan. Have you got your tool kit?

Todd: Check.

BoJack: Burner phone?

Todd: Check.

BoJack: Cyanide capsule?

Todd: Check. Wait, why do we need—

BoJack: Okay, let's get started. Step one: Enter the study. Step Two: Plant incriminating—

Mr. Peanutbutter: Hello? Todd?

Todd: Uh—Hi, Mr.Peanutbutter.

BoJack: Take the cyanide, Todd. Take the cyanide! And hup. Hup. And hup No.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Are you here to interview to be my driver?

Todd: Um—yes, I am.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Brilliant. I didn't even post the ad yet. Here's me thinking destiny over here.

BoJack: And hup. Yeah! Hu-aah!

Mr. Peanutbutter: Thank you for your interest in the role of driver. I know you don't have your resume with you, so I've taken the liberty of letting you use mine.

Todd: Yeah, thanks. Here, business boss.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Let's just have a look here. Mm-hmm. Oh, ho, with a resume like this, you should be the one hiring a driver. Just kidding. I know it's my resume. But I see you went to Northwestern. You know, I'm an N.U. man myself.

Todd: Go, fighting Westerns.

Mr. Peanutbutter: And it says here you do a great Rodney Dangerfield impression. Give us a taste.

Todd: Uh, okay. "I'm Roger Dangerfield."

Mr. Peanutbutter: Huh! No respect, indeed. Todd, you got the job.

    (in a car) 

Todd: Oh. Can you believe this weather we're having?

Mr. Peanutbutter: No, I cannot believe this weather we're having! Oh, wow. We make a great pair. It's like I'm Miss Daisy, and you're Minnie Driver.

BoJack: (on the phone) Hey, I'm bored. And I think Todd swallowed a cyanide pill and might be dead. Wanna come over and bang it out?

Princess Carolyn: Appealing as that sounds, I have lunch plans with Vincent. I know that might be hard for you to hear.

BoJack: Wait, that guy from the bar who is actually three boys stacked on top of each other under a trench coat?

Princess Carolyn: Well, don't fly into a jealous rage about it.

BoJack: Not jealous. Just reminding you that you are trying to have a relationship with someone who is and again, it's bizarre I should have to point this out — three young boys stacked on top of each other under a trench coat.

Princess Carolyn: He listens to me.

BoJack: Okay, okay, but can you just acknowledge that -

Princess Carolyn: That you are being jealous? Oh, oh! Already acknowledged. Toodles.

BoJack: Look who's not dead.

Todd: Better than not dead. You are looking at Mr.Peanutbutter's new driver.

BoJack: You're his driver? That's perfect. Now you can infiltrate Mr.Peanutbutter's inner circle.

Todd: I don't know, BoJack.

BoJack: Sure, you'll act all friendly, gain his trust, chauffer him around on his little errands to the groomer and whatnot, but all the while, you'll be studying him, scouring out his weaknesses, biding your time till we're ready to strike. And once you zero in on his Achilles' heel, we will take, him, down.

Todd: Hooray. Betrayal.

    (in a car) 

Todd: Oh, man. Oh, man. Keep it cool, Todd.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Hey, pal. If you're making small talk up there, how about sending a little my way?

Todd: Um can you believe this weather we're having?

Mr. Peanutbutter: No, I cannot believe this weather we're having!

    TUESDAY 

BoJack: Hey, weren't you supposed to be here like a half hour ago?

Diane: Yeah, I've just been sitting in my car. Listen, I was looking over my notes, and I think I have enough to go write the book, so I'm just going to do that?

BoJack: You don't want to interview me anymore? But don't you want to know what my Rosebud is?

Diane: You told me repeatedly it was the nudie magazine your uncle showed you with the three-nippled woman.

BoJack: Who was she?

Diane: I got it all.

BoJack: Oh, okay. Well, I'll see you around though, right?

Diane: Yeah. I, um.. Why did you have to make things weird, BoJack?

BoJack: I made things weird?

Mr. Peanutbutter: So if you see anything you know we need, like this biscuit warmer, you just run the laser over the barcode, and kablamsky! It goes in the registry.

Diane: And that way, everybody knows what I want. And I know what I want.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Uh

Diane: Which is what everyone wants. And it's really clear, and nobody's confused about anything.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Am I crazy, or are you not into this?

Diane: No, I am. It's just.. The big wedding in Nantucket, all these presents I'm so overwhelmed, I can barely consider whether I want or need a biscuit warmer, which I think is how people end up with biscuit warmers.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Close your eyes. Come on. Okay, picture our lives together. It's a cold Sunday morning a bunch of years from now. Maybe robots have taken over, maybe they haven't. I don't know. It's the future. This story isn't about that. The important thing is it's Sunday morning. I brought you the paper, fetched your slippers. You come into the kitchen—Can you smell biscuits?

Diane: Yes.

Mr. Peanutbutter: So can I. Are they warm?

Diane: Yeah.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Well, that's all a biscuit warmer's for. Look, if marriage stresses you out, we don't have to get married.

Diane: It's not the marriage. It's the wedding and the year of build-up.

Mr. Peanutbutter: So forget all that. I've done the whole big wedding thing. I don't need to do it again. Let's do something small and casual right here in town next month.

Diane: Honestly, that would be amazing. But we'd have to cancel the doves, and we wouldn't be able to send out those fancy invitations you liked.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Those doves were being jerks anyway. And invitations? They're just a scam made up by the Post Office to keep tabs on us. Post Office.

Diane: Settle down, boy.

Todd: And then we talked about his favorite Smash Mouth CDs. And— Oh, oh. And then that led to the whole conversations about sticks. Oh, and let me tell you, Mr.Peanutbutter has got some serious opinions about sticks.

BoJack: Why are you telling me this?

Todd: What? You said you wanted every detail. Did I mention he got a new bandana?

BoJack: Give me something I can use to make them call off their wedding.

Todd: Oh, yeah. Did I not tell you? They called off their wedding.

BoJack: What? Thank God! Oh, the universe makes sense.

Todd: They decided against a big destination wedding, so they're doing it here sometime next month.

BoJack: What?

Todd: I guess saying they called it off is probably not right.

BoJack: Ugh—

Todd: Hey, what's this? ("JURY SUMMONS")

BoJack: Oh, yes, I got jury duty, but I can't worry about that right now. That is a problem for Friday BoJack. Now think, Todd. Gotta have something I can use sloshing around in that pot-infused Jell-O shot you call a brain.

Todd: Let's see. Mr.Peanutbutter likes having his tummy scratched, and Diane's family is from Vietnam, which is where Vietnamese food comes from, and since that goes in your tummy..

BoJack: Okay, stop thinking. Just give me raw data. What's happening this week?

Todd: Well, the circus is in town. Congress is going to vote on the new Education Bill..

BoJack: With Mr.Peanutbutter! What's happening with Mr.Peanutbutter?!

Todd: Well, I'm taking Diane and him to the bank on Thursday.

BoJack: I can use that. I can actually use that.

    WEDNESDAY, "Silver Spoon Diner" 

Margo Martindale: I don't know if I'm up for staging a bank robbery, BoJack.

BoJack: Oh, come on, character actress Margo Martindale. They say that there are no good parts for women over 50. I want to stick an AK-47 in your hand and prove them wrong.

Margo: I do tire of the limitations of stage, film, and television.

BoJack: You might as well perform in a cage, am I right? This is guerilla theater: no stage, no script, no net.

Margo: It's the kind of work we talked about doing that night in the desert.

BoJack: Don't tell me we left those dreams in the sweat lodge.

Margo: Hell, I'll do it.

    THURSDAY, BANK 

Mr. Peanutbutter: And that little boy never found his mother.

BoJack: Hey, guys.

Mr. Peanutbutter: BoJack Horseman?

Diane: Oh. Hi.

BoJack: What a weird coincidence. I did not know you would be here today.

Diane: How are things?

BoJack: Things are good. You? Things good with you?

Margo: Hands behind your head, everybody. Nobody moves, nobody gets shot.

BoJack: What an unfortunate surprise.

Margo: Well, well, isn't that a pretty ring?

BoJack: This one.

Margo: Well, well, isn't that a pretty ring? I'll take it.

Diane: But it's my engagement ring.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Give it to her, Diane. It's just a ring.

Margo: Just a ring? That ring is a symbol of your love. If you don't care about the ring, it really makes me wonder if you care about the woman wearing it.

BoJack: That terrifying bank robber is making some very cogent points.

Diane: No, Mr. Peanutbutter's right. If the ring is just a symbol for love, why would I need a symbol when I have the real thing right here?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Yeah, we don't need rings, we have each other.

Diane: Hey, why are we even waiting a month to get married? If anything, this bank robbery is reminding me that life is short. We should get married even sooner!

BoJack: No..

Mr. Peanutbutter: What do you mean sooner?

Diane: Why not this weekend? We could get married Saturday. Am I crazy?

BoJack: Yes. Don't do it.

Margo: Oh, keep the damn thing.

ALL: Aw.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Okay. Saturday it is.

BoJack: What the hell just happened?

Margo: Something truly beauti.. Aah!

Diane: Oh.

Margo: Get your hands off me! No! Not—

    "BELLICAN'S" 

Mr. Peanutbutter: — Uh-oh. Long story short, Erica did have to lose the foot, but she gained a friend. Sorry, kind of went off on a tangent there. Diane and I wanna thank you all for coming to our impromptu rehearsal dinner, even though we did not actually have time to organize a rehearsal.

Diane: Or a dinner.

Mr. Peanutbutter: But there is an open bar which you are all welcome to partake in as soon as I finish this toast, which I will be doing ri-i-i-ight after one more quick anecdote.

ALL: Oh—

Mr. Peanutbutter: It was winter in Prague, and the consumption hung low in the air—

BoJack: Well, the bank thing was a dud. Thanks a lot, Todd.

Todd: Well, you win some, you lose some. It's like Vincent always says: "Oopsy."

BoJack: Vincent?

Todd: Yeah, Princess Carolyn's boyfriend. We've hung out a couple of times.

BoJack: What are you ta

Todd: That dude is funny.

BoJack: You know he's not a person, right?

Todd: Look, I don't want to get in the middle of your whole thing with Princess Carolyn.

BoJack: It's not about that. I just don't understand why nobody else seems to notice that she is dating a man who is clearly three little boys doing the thing from The Little Rascals.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Oh, that reminds me of another funny story.

BoJack: If I could say a few words?

Mr. Peanutbutter: BoJack Horseman. Take the mic. Spin us a yarn.

BoJack: Mr.Peanutbutter, Diane. Since I am friends with both of you and have no ulterior motives—

Mr. Peanutbutter: Mm-hmm.

BoJack: I would like to offer my restaurant as a venue for your wedding.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Wow! Really?

Diane: I don't know. That's too generous.

BoJack: Hey, don't look a horse's gift in the mouth, right?

Mr. Peanutbutter: I get it. Like the song.

Diane: That's not a song.

Mr. Peanutbutter: All right, everyone. That's it for the toasts. Enjoy yourselves and each other.

BoJack: This is perfect. Now that the wedding's at my restaurant, we have the home field advantage. Perfect for sabotage.

Princess Carolyn: BoJack, I need to thank you. (hugs him) You calling me to the bar the other night turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me. I think I'm in love.

BoJack: Okay. This "person" you're in love with—Have you seen him without his trench coat on?

Princess Carolyn: I don't understand why you can't be happy for me. He's a good boyfriend.

Todd: I actually think you and Vincent would really hit it off if you gave him a chance. You should spend some one-on-one time with him.

BoJack: You mean one-on-three time? Because there are three of him.

Princess Carolyn: We get it. You don't like him.

BoJack: I'm actually not sure you do get it.

Mr. Peanutbutter: I know what's been going on.

Todd: Ah! I wasn't gonna pee. I was just taking my penis out.

Mr. Peanutbutter: You've been driving me around, but there was something else happening the whole time. I see it now.

Todd: What are you talking about?

Mr. Peanutbutter: You weren't just working as my driver, Todd. You were becoming my friend.

Todd: Oh, yeah. That was happening.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Well, I could use a friend right about now. There's something I really gotta get off my chest, and if it got out, it could destroy the whole wedding.

Todd: No, I'm not great with sensitive information.

Mr. Peanutbutter: I don't know if I'm ready to get married again. Don't get me wrong. I love Diane so much. I didn't have any doubts until I realized she had doubts. Then I figured she's smarter than I am. Maybe she knows things I don't.

Todd: You are kind of unloading a lot of sensitive information here.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Sure, I think I'm ready to commit to Diane, but I can't even commit to my favorite type of stick. Yes, today, it's short and knobby, but tomorrow?

Todd: Well, sure, Diane is short, but I don't know about knobby.

Mr. Peanutbutter: The last thing I want to do is hurt Diane, but I keep having this dream where she's gone. There's no break-up, no tragedy. She's just gone, and my life continues without her. And it terrifies me to say this, but in the dream I feel.. relief. Hey, thanks for listening to all this. You're a really good friend, Todd.

    (in a car) 

BoJack: Since you weren't able to give me any useful intel, I had to offer up my restaurant, but now, we're on my turf. Time for operation "I don't."

Todd: Yeah, sounds good.

BoJack: You know, with my knack for coming up with plans and your ability to hear them without contributing more than three words at a time, we make a pretty good team, don't we, Todd?

Todd: You said it.

BoJack: See?

    TV 

Tom Jumbo-Grumbo: Beloved character actress Margo Martindale is in police custody tonight for her role in a failed bank robbery.

Todd: Margo Martindale?

Tom: But first, pizza for breakfast? The answer might surprise you.

Todd: I know her, but how? Wait. She was at the convenience store the night I bought that video game and ruined my rock opera.

    (flashback) 

She's the one who asked me to hand her that tape from the 10 cent bin.

That means Margo Martindale likes tapes! And a tape is something you listen to, but tape is also a sticky thing you can use to seal boxes. Boxes is what cereal comes in. What does it all mean? Am I just grasping at straws? Wait. Straws.. That's it. Straws are used to drink soda or water, and plants need water. And BoJack used Margo Martindale as a plant at the bank and the convenience store, which means.. Ugh! BoJack hired Margo Martindale to make me find that video game so he could kill my rock opera! Aw, dude.

    FRYDAY, JUNE 13 

BoJack: Rise and shine, Todd.

Todd: I didn't sleep.

BoJack: Well, we're down to the wire, but we still got one more day to figure out how to stop this wedding, and I can't afford to waste one second, so let's get.. Oh, shit. Forgot about jury duty. Damn you, Tuesday BoJack.

    "CENTRAL JUSTICE CENTER 700 JUSTICE DRIVE" 

Advocate: And so, you saw the defendant.

Witness: Yes.

Advocate: That man, the defendant.. You saw him?

BoJack: Come on, come on, come on. Hurry up.

Witness: That's correct.

Advocate: The defendant was seen by you.

BoJack: Sweet Jesus. Some of us have weddings to ruin.

Witness: Yes.

Advocate: No further questions, Your Honor. I'm sorry. I misspoke. A lot of further questions.

BoJack: Ugh

    SATURDAY 

Judge: The jury finds the defendant not guilty on all charges.

Man: We did the right thing today, BoJack. But you know who the real winner is?

(Together, in unison:) Man: Justice. BoJack: Mr.Peanutbutter.

Margo: BoJack.

BoJack: There's my superstar. How are you?

Margo: Amazing! This has been the role of a lifetime. I think they're gonna send me up to Lompoc, and when I get there, I'm gonna find the meanest, hardest queen bitch of the yard, and I'm going to bite her finger off. (laughs) That'll show everyone I'm crazy, and you don't mess with crazy. Plus, free finger. Oh, here I am blabbering on about my plans. Did you ever stop that wedding?

BoJack: It's actually happening right now. I ran out of time.

Margo: I never understood why it was so important to keep those two apart.

BoJack: I was just trying to be a good friend in my own shitty, ass-backwards way. Diane deserves the best. She's smart and kind and beautiful, and it's gonna be mostly synonyms from here on if I keep going, and.. I'm in love with her.

Margo: Tell her that, BoJack. You don't need kooky schemes or nutty capers. Just go to her and speak from your heart. Then find the biggest person at the wedding and bite his finger off!

BoJack: You're right, partly. I've gotta tell her how I feel. Okay, I'm gonna do it. Good luck with your finger thing.

    "ELEFANTE" 

BoJack: Todd, thank God you're here! Did I miss it? Is it too late?

Todd: Dude. I'm done with this. No. No. Mr.Peanutbutter's been nice to me.

BoJack: Mr.Peanutbutter is nice to everybody. That's what makes him so stupid.

Todd: No, I'm stupid. But even I know that the only reason you're doing this is because you're in love with Diane.

BoJack: Yes, that's right. And I'm here to finally tell her how I feel.

Todd: BoJack, she knows how you feel.

BoJack: How? I barely just realized ..

Todd: Hey, man, she made her choice. Look around. This day is not about you, okay? So maybe you should just stop trying to mess with other people's lives.

Diane: I never thought I wanted to get married. It's so weird, this idea of dedicating yourself to something for the rest of your life. Like, how could you know, right? But then I realized it's okay to not know everything. And some things take a leap of faith. Mr.Peanutbutter, I want to take that leap with you.

Roxy: By the power vested in me by one of those dumb websites, I now pronounce you married. Go ahead. Kiss, you lovesick dummies.

    "Mmm-yeah I used to think maybe— " 

Mr. Peanutbutter: Hey, Todd. Todd. Thanks for hearing me out the other night. I'm really glad I went through with this. This is the happiest day of my life.

Todd: Always happy to be of service.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Oh, and, um, I got you something.

Todd: Todd Chavez? Hey. That name's my name. What's "PB Livin'"?

Mr. Peanutbutter: My film production company. Read your title.

Todd: "Executive Vice President of West Coast Operations." Whoa! Does that mean I control the waves?

Mr. Peanutbutter: No, it means you're my assistant. You've got a big future ahead of you, and I don't want you to waste any time looking back. So I got all my cars' mirrors taken off.

Todd: Isn't that kind of dangerous?

Mr. Peanutbutter: What do I care? I'm not driving.

Diane: Hey, BoJack. Thanks for coming. I wasn't sure you were gonna make it.

BoJack: Wouldn't have missed it for the world.

Diane: You're a good friend. I'm really glad to know you. Mwah.

BoJack: Sorry that I.. If I made things weird.

Diane: They weren't that weird.

BoJack: Oh.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Diane, honey?

Diane: Oh, I gotta go dance with my husband. Duh! I'm married!

Vincent: Hi.

BoJack: So you're the quote-unquote person, singular, that everyone's so crazy about. What have you got figured out that I don't?

Vincent: Um, adult stuff.

BoJack: Yeah, I'm not seeing it. But that doesn't matter. Not everything's about me. And maybe I am a little jealous. Not because I actually want to date Princess Carolyn anymore, but just because I don't like the idea that I can't. I guess I just assumed I always could. But I made a lot of bad decisions. Not just with her. With.. with everyone, really. You know, Princess Carolyn was right. You are a good listener.

Vincent: Thanks.

BoJack: You know, sometimes I feel like I was born with a leak, and any goodness I started with just slowly spilled out of me, and now it's all gone. And I'll never get it back in me. It's too late. Life is a series of closing doors, isn't it?

Vincent: Don't be sad. Good horsey.

BoJack: That actually feels kind of nice. 

BoJack: "We're very different, but I think that we bring out the best in each other. It's like you're chocolate and I'm Mr. Peanutbutter."

Naomi Watts: "Shut up and kiss me, you silly goof."

Quentin Tarantulino: Cut!

A Ryan Seacrest Type: Welcome back to Excess Hollywoo. I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type, and I'm visiting the set of Mr. Peanutbutter's Hollywoo Heist. I'm thrilled to be talking to the star of the film, BoJack Horseman, and his real life inspiration, Mr.Peanutbutter.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Am I an inspiration? Well, that depends on how you define—Wait a minute. Yes, I am.

BoJack: Ugh.

Mr. Peanutbutter: You know, I'm just over the moon to be producing this movie about my daring exploit.

BoJack: Yes, Your daring exploit.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Yes. It's such a treat to be shooting in my very own casa. And it's an even sweeter treat to be played by my good amigo—dare I say best amigo?

BoJack: You "daren't."

Mr. Peanutbutter: We're so in tune. We even finish each other's—sentences. Sometimes it doesn't happen.

BoJack: It never—

Mr. Peanutbutter: Happens. Ah, see? I'm inside him.

A Ryan: BoJack, you haven't worked in quite some time. In fact, I thought you were dead. You must be so grateful to be working again and also alive, which, again, I thought you were not. How did you get involved with this?

BoJack: Well..

    FLASHBACK ONE 

BoJack: You want me to play Mr. Peanutbutter in the story he stole from me? I stole the D, and then he stole my stealing of it. That makes him an idea thief, which is much less cool than a thief thief, which is what I am and what he also is.

Princess Carolyn: You know what might help? If you think about this like a professional instead of a big titty baby. This movie is a huge opportunity. Quentin Tarantulino is known for revitalizing dead careers. This could do for you what Reservoir Dogs did for Rin Tin Tin.

BoJack: But isn't there any other part? I could play myself.

Princess Carolyn: No, BoJack's already being played by Wallace Shawn.

BoJack: What? The short guy from The Princess Bride who says "inconceivable?" Why Wallace Shawn?

    FLASHBACK TWO 

Wallace Shawn: BoJack Horseman? I don't want to play that boob.

Princess Carolyn: I'm trying to help you out, Wally. You're the one who keeps buying expensive Rothkos.

Wallace: I have a disease. Would you tell an alcoholic to stop buying alcohol?

Princess Carolyn: You know, Black and Blue Number 7's going up for auction next week.

Wallace: Fine. I'll do the dumb movie.

    FLASHBACK ONE 

BoJack: Fine. I'll do the dumb movie. But if you find me in a bathtub with open wrists tomorrow and the words "I hate my agent" smeared across the walls in blood, you'll know why.

    EXCESS HOLLYWOO 

BoJack: So obviously I'm thrilled to be here, just thrilled.

Woman: Cast and crew only.

Diane: I know you're just doing your job, but I live here, and the crew has been here since 3:00 a.m., so I'm a little tired.

Woman: Cast and crew only.

BoJack: Hey, stranger. Haven't really seen you since the wedding. Kind of feels like we're coming back to school after summer vacation.

Diane: Yeah. I'll see you at the pep rally.

BoJack: Hope we don't get Mrs. Kirkman for trig this year.

Diane: Yeah, well, I hope the cheerleaders don't stuff me in a locker and write "virgin slut" on my forehead, and then when I ask how I could be both a virgin and a slut, they make me eat a lipstick.

BoJack: Uh..

Diane: So what have you been up to these last couple months?

BoJack: Well, I've been pretty busy. Met a girl at Soho House.

Diane: Was she your waitress?

BoJack: Yes. Then I met a girl at Mastro's.

Diane: Was she also your waitress?

BoJack: Yes. Then I met a girl at P.F.Chang's.

Diane: Let me guess. She was your..

BoJack: A hooker, yes, but what she really wants to do is wait tables.

Diane: Well, I, for one, would love to meet the aspiring food-service worker who finally gets you to settle down.

BoJack: What? Why would I want to settle down? I'm 50. .. Yeah, anyway..

Diane: So I'm sending the first draft of the book to Pinky this afternoon.

BoJack: What? It's done?

Diane: Not yet. Almost. I'm excited for you to read it, but I'm also cripplingly nervous. I actually kind of feel like throwing up, but I can't throw up because I haven't had anything to eat because this lady won't let me in my own kitchen.

Woman: Cast and crew only.

BoJack: Listen, if reading a book you wrote is anywhere near as great as it is to actually spend time with you, I'm sure it's gonna be wonderful. Having said that, what do I know about books? I'm just a dumb actor.

A Ryan Seacrest Type: I'm here with Hollywoo darling Naomi Watts. Tell me, what attracted you to the role of Diane?

Naomi Watts: I just keep getting pigeonholed as these complex characters in highly acclaimed movies. For once, I would just love to phone it in and play a two-dimensional girl in a Rom-Com with no inner life of her own. That's kind of the reason I got into this business.

A Ryan: Ha ha! You said words. Now, is it true you stay in character between takes?

Naomi: Oh, we all do. The director insists upon it. He even has everyone calling me Diane to help me get in the head-space. It's been great.

Quentin Tarantulino: Diane, looking good.

Diane: Um, thanks.

Quentin: Ugh, not you. I was talking to Diane.

Naomi Watts: Oh, thank you. Now, where's my peanut butter?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Right over here, Q.

Quentin: No, I'm looking for peanut butter.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Oh, you mean BoJack?

Quentin: If I wanted BoJack, I would call BoJack.

Wallace Shawn: Did someone call for BoJack?

Naomi Watts: It really cuts down on confusion.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Ah, show business, the great equalizer.

Todd: Is that what it is?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Todd, spritz me.

Todd: Spritzing.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Mm, mm, mm. Well spritzed. Have you ever been on a movie set before?

Todd: No, sir, Mr. Peanutbutter.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Please, Mr. Peanutbutter was my father's name.

Todd: Uh

Mr. Peanutbutter: And it's also my name! Ooh, speaking of Mr.Peanutbutter, I'll be back in a jiff, skippy. Keep that air spritzed for me. (to BoJack) Aloha, Kemo Sabe. Hey, allow me to put on my producer hat and produce you just for one second here. I have a few notes on how you're playing me. Let's see. Problems, problems, problems, ah, here we go. I find it really troubling that my movie self is wearing a crew neck T-shirt. I only wear V-necks. You see the problem.

BoJack: I do not.

Mr. Peanutbutter: I just think if we're telling the story, we should tell it how it really happened.

BoJack: Yeah, this whole story isn't how it really happened.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Right.. because of the shirts.

BoJack: Because I'm the one who stole the D. I'm the real hero here. My life is full of exciting adventures. I should write a book. Oh, wait. I did. Suck on that, society.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Hey, you're in a mood. Perhaps the tightness of that crew neck is cutting off circulation to the brain? Let me talk to Donna in wardrobe. We're gonna fix this, buddy. Donna!

Diane: What are you doing?

Naomi Watts: I'm just trying to get inside my character, which is you. Is this how we move our arms? We're so weird.

Diane: Is this really necessary?

Naomi: "Is this really necessary?"

Diane: That's not what I sound like.

Naomi: "That's not mut mi sound mike." Hey, what's it been like since we got married? Is it everything we dreamed of since we were little?

Diane: When I was little, I dreamed of getting a MacArthur grant for my 'zine about how all the girls at school were bitches.

Naomi: Oh.

Diane: Look, the wedding was great. But that's not real life. I mean, I guess I got a happy ending, but every happy ending has the day after the happy ending, right? And the day after that. So the wedding was so much fun. It was the happiest day of my life. But, you know, what does that say about all the days I have left?

Naomi: Whoa. We're such a Zoë.

BoJack: Oh, Todd, glad you're here. Hold this. Todd, my jacket is on the floor. You're supposed to hold the jacket so it doesn't go on the floor.

Todd: Hey, sorry, BoJack I mean, uh, Mr. Peanutbutter. But I work for Mr. Peanutbutter now. I mean, uh, Mr. Peanutbutter.

BoJack: Ugh.

Todd: I can't believe I'm on a movie set, you know? I mean, this is my first chance to work on something big since my rock opera fell apart. Man, I really messed up that huge career opportunity all on my own, didn't I?

BoJack: Uh—

Todd: Nothing sabotaged me one bit.

BoJack: Yep. You said it.

Todd: Well, see you later.

Lenny Turteltaub: Where can I grab a nosh?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Oh, craft services is in the kitchen. Up the driveway, through the living room, make a left. Can't miss it.

Lenny: I'm gonna grab a quick bite. Don't do anything stupid while I'm gone.

Quentin: Okay, fellas, here's the thing about the story. I, don't, buy it. It's like something's missing, but I can't put any of my fingers on it.

Woman: Um, maybe once we add the music—

Quentin: The music? Are you kidding me? Music? You're fired. What dumb shit brought this dumb shit? Okay, you're fired too. Oh, okay. Anyone else got any bright ideas?

Todd: Oh, oh, oh, oh! Hey, maybe it make it more—Diane-y?

Quentin: Um, excuse me?

Todd: I don't know. This is probably stupid, but the whole story's about how this guy's in love with this lady, right? But we don't even know who she is or what she wants. I mean, maybe give her more lines or words or, I don't know, feelings or whatever?

Quentin: What?!

Mr. Peanutbutter: He's new. He doesn't know the rules. Forgive him, mighty Caesar.

Quentin: Yes. Yeah. I love you. Who is this kid? You're a genius. I'm gonna kiss your face.

Todd: What? Oh!

Quentin: Come back to my web. Let's talk about Diane's feelings and make this baby sing.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Hey, Todd, talk to him about the wardrobe, specifically the top half of the wardrobe, specifically the shirt part of the top half of the wardrobe, specifically the neck part of the shirt part of the wardrobe.

Princess Carolyn: Ugh. What now?

BoJack: I'm sick of this dog and pony show. The movie is dumb. Mr.Peanutbutter is annoying the shit out of me, and there's too much honeydew in the fruit bowl.

Princess Carolyn: Blech. Honeydew is garbage fruit.

BoJack: Also, why is BoJack being played by an old, nebbishy five-foot-tall bald guy? Is that how the world sees me?

Wallace Shawn: Oh, I see. So I can play Vanya on 42nd Street, but I'm not a deft-enough talent to capture the essence of the elusive BoJack Horseman. So sorry to offend you, sir.

BoJack: I'm just glad my book's coming out soon so people will get an opportunity to see the real BoJack Horseman.

Princess Carolyn: Oh, are you coming out with a book? You never mentioned it.

BoJack: Plus, Todd's being super weird. I think he's onto me.

Princess Carolyn: Onto you in regards to what?

BoJack: Oh, right, I didn't tell you. I sabotaged his rock opera by getting him readdicted to a video game because I didn't want him to move out.

Princess Carolyn: Jesus Christ, BoJack.

BoJack: Anyway, I think he knows and might be plotting to sabotage me back.

Princess Carolyn: Why is it that 90% of our conversations these days revolve around plotting sabotages?

BoJack: Are you saying I should plot a counter-sabotage?

Princess Carolyn: No, no more plotting. Just be a good soldier and do your job. Nobody is out to get you.

Naomi Watts: Have you seen the new draft? They took it all off you and put it on me.

BoJack: What?

Naomi: Apparently some dickweed named Todd decided I should be three-dimensional and you should have no lines. Ugh. Isn't this town sick of creating three-dimensional roles for women? This happens to me all the time! A.O. Scott is sick of talking about how brilliant I am.

BoJack: Todd.

Naomi Watts: "I guess what I've been saying for the last seven uninterrupted minutes is, how can I forgive my father if I can't forgive myself?"

BoJack: "True dat."

Naomi: "But none of that matters, because we bring out the best in each other. I'm the chocolate, and you're Mr.Peanutbutter!"

BoJack: "True dat."

Naomi: "Mwah!"

Quentin: Cut! Amazing. This is the movie that I wanted to make. This is gonna be great. Oh, my God, I'm so..

Lenny: Ugh, what kind of idiot puts food on top of a hill?

Naomi Watts: Hey, so I guess now that the movie's all about Diane, I really need to dig deep and get to know the real you. So let's talk and talk and talk until I am you and you are nothing but a hollowed-out husk of your former self and every thought and every feeling you ever had belongs to me and me alone. So do we like Sprite, or are we more of a 7-Up girl?

Diane: Uh, that all sounds great. But, you know, the person you should really be talking to is that guy.

BoJack: Yeah, okay, I'm done.

Diane: Diane loves talking to him. They have a great rapport. In fact, Diane could spend all day talking to him and never talk to me again.

Naomi: Oh, I get it, because Diane doesn't talk to Diane. Diane talks to -

Diane: Anybody else.

BoJack: Hey, Todd, remember that time when you wouldn't clean up your shit? That was hilarious. We've had some good times.

Todd: Oh. Hi.

BoJack: So I was thinking, I have some—pretty sloppy seconds left over from P.F.Chang's in the fridge, and I don't think that I want it anymore. Maybe tonight you could eat it. Friendly gesture because we're friends.

Todd: Uh—

Quentin: Oh-oh, there's my guy. I heard you had a few more thoughts about the script.

Todd: I do. I was just thinking, what if we made the BoJack character into a real shithead?

Quentin: Is that really necessary?

BoJack: I don't think it's necessary.

Todd: Yeah, let's... Let's make him be a real selfish asshole so the audience has someone to root against.

Quentin: You're probably right. Let's take another swing at the script and give BoJack more to do.

BoJack: Now, when you say, "Give BoJack more to do" —Not now, Mr. Peanutbutter.

Todd: And also, now that I'm thinking about it, why does the movie have to take place on Earth?

Quentin: You are blowing my head. I hope you like Oscars.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Honeydew? More like, "Honey, do I enjoy eating it? Yes, I do." Right?

BoJack: Not right, and I would love to go through all the reasons why, but I've got bigger concerns right now.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Honeydew, go on.

BoJack: Did you notice that the Mr.Peanutbutter part has been cut in half? What is happening to our movie?

Mr. Peanutbutter: I thought you hated the movie.

BoJack: Yeah, I do, but if I'm gonna be in a dumb movie I hate that makes no sense, I should at least be the star of it.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Look, I agree that this movie has really lost its way. I mean, first of all, why would Mr. Peanutbutter wear a crew neck T-shirt? And second of all, uh.....

BoJack: It's just the shirt, isn't it?

Mr. Peanutbutter: It doesn't make sense. I'm a V-neck man. A V you can put your sunglasses in. Can you do that with a crew neck? Because I'd like to see you tr..

Lenny: Whoa. Bagel.

Naomi Watts: Thanks so much for running this scene with me. I have so many lines to learn.

BoJack: Yeah, well, most of my lines are, "True dat," but I guess it never hurts to practice.

Naomi: "The citizens of Planet D want their king back. But I'm more concerned with getting my self-esteem back after being in the shadow of powerful men for so long."

BoJack: "True dat."

Naomi: Is it just me, or is this movie kind of flying off the rails?

BoJack: Well, I don't want to overuse my catchphrase here, but true dat.

Naomi: "This is so typical. I just wanted to do something light and fun to distract me from the deep well of sadness that is my life. You probably wouldn't understand."

BoJack: "Oh, puh-lease. I'm so deep down a well of sadness that Baby Jessica is like, "Damn."

Naomi: "Shut up and kiss me, you miserable goof."

BoJack: What?

Naomi: Mwah

BoJack: Oh. Okay.

Naomi: Mwah.

BoJack: Pop this in a drawer. Huh?

Naomi: This is good, baby.

BoJack: Oh, this is amazing. Naomi, I haven't felt like this since..

Naomi: No, no, shh, shh, shh! Call me Diane.

Lenny: Okay, got my bagel. Now back to work.

Diane: Hey, guys. Hey, guys! Wow, wow. So you guys really hit it off, huh? That's—awesome.

BoJack: Want to do some hand stuff in the bathroom before we go down to set?

Naomi Watts: You read my mind. Now, kiss me some sour cream.

Diane: Hey, so I finished the book and sent the draft to the publishers.

BoJack: What? My book is ready? Let me read it. Can I read it?

Diane: Call Pinky. He'll probably send you a copy as soon as he's done with it.

BoJack: All right! You hang tight, baby. I got an instant classic to read. Keep the engine running, though, because if I know me, this book is gonna give me a pretty big erection.

Diane: Okay, enjoy! Keep an open mind. You'll love it. It's a work in progress.

    "PENGUIN PUBLISHING" 

Pinky Penguin: Hello. Penguin Publishing. Unless this is that loan shark, in which case, Johnny's House of Noodles. May I interest you in our bento lunch box?

BoJack: Pinky, it's me. Let me read the book. Give me, give me, give me.

Pinky: Okay, okay, now, I should warn you, it's not quite what we expected, but it is good. I'm telling you, this could really sell. I might actually get to see my kids again.

BoJack: Great. Send it over. I'll read it right now.

Pinky: All right, I sent it, but just remember

BoJack: To set my expectations sky-high? Way ahead of you. All right, book, let's see what you got. BoJack, this is you.

"ONE TRICK PONY by DIANE NGUYEN"

(Diane's voice-over) "The first time I met BoJack Horseman, he was puking cotton candy off the deck of his lavish house in the Hills, the lights of the city twinkling below us. ... The Make-A-Wish kids will not soon forget the time the great BoJack Horseman referred to their parents as 'a bunch of used jizz bags.' ... He filled the air with words, terrified of silence, as one often is who is smart enough to recognize his many personal failings but unwilling or unable to take the steps required to fix them. ... Got out of the car, stepped out toward the coast, and looked across the water, and for a moment, he said nothing." .. What the shit was that?

BoJack: What the shit is this?

Diane: It's a phone. Well, a tiny computer, really. I mean, amazing what technology can..

BoJack: You were supposed to ghostwrite my memoir, but instead you wrote a story about how you spent six months with me and saw what a big, dumb loser I am.

Diane: Well, I realized that the best way to fully capture you, warts and all..

BoJack: This isn't warts and all. It's just warts. Where's the all? I come off like a total asshole.

Diane: You come off as complex and deeply troubled but ultimately sympathetic. You might be too close to see that.

BoJack: There's an entire chapter about me eating apple fritters.

Diane: You did go through that fritter phase.

BoJack: Is this book how you see me? That day we ran errands together, I thought that we had a really good time, but you just wrote about how I cried because the dry cleaner took my head shot down.

Diane: You were very emotional.

BoJack: They didn't even replace me with anyone. Now it's just a faded spot where my face used to be.

Diane: This will actually do wonders for your career. Trust me. I mean, you're just a dumb actor who doesn't know anything about books, right?

BoJack: What?

Diane: Remember? From before?

BoJack: Oh, I don't think you understand what's happening here. This is not a casual conversation between friends. This is your boss telling his employee that she did a bad job. Try again.

Diane: What?!

BoJack: Start over, but do it right this time. Nobody is ever gonna see this.

Diane: Ugh!

Wayne: (on the phone) Diane?

Diane: Hey, Wayne, you still work for BuzzFeed?

Wayne: Um, yes.

Diane: 'Cause I got something that's gonna get you a shit-ton of hearts or digs or smileys or whatever the hell you measure your journalism with.

Wallace Shawn: "Curses! My evil plan has been defeated, but I'll be back. You haven't heard the last of Evil Emperor BoJackitron Horsemaniac. Oh, no! You shot a laser at me! Oh, no! I'm dying. Oh, no, I'm dead."

Woman: "And so now that we've escaped the evil clutches of the emperor, I'm free to assume my natural form, an all-knowing floating orb of light?"

BoJack: "True dat."

Quentin: Cut, cut.

BoJack: Come on, guys, this is ridiculous. Is this even a movie anymore?

Todd: Oh, maybe it isn't a movie.

Quentin: Yeah, maybe it's an immersive smartphone app or a 21st-century approach to 360-degree media envelopment.

Todd: Yeah, or maybe it's just, like, a feeling, you know?

Quentin: We've got work to do.

Todd: Yeah, yeah.

Quentin: Oh, my God, this is so good. Oh, this is gonna be awesome. Yes! Go, Todd.

BoJack: Hello? Are you just gonna leave me like this? Anyone?

BoJack: Ah! Oh, good. You're here.

Naomi Watts: Oh, hi, BoJack.

BoJack: This whole day's been a shit show. The book turned out to be a total hatchet job. The movie's a disaster. But thank God I have one good thing in my life, and that's you.

Naomi: BoJack, I..

BoJack: Please let me say this before I lose my nerve.

Naomi: Wait wait..

BoJack: I spent 50 years roaming the countryside as a wild stallion, but I am tired of the rodeo..

Naomi: Whoa--

BoJack: .. and I'm finally ready to saddle up.

Naomi: BoJack--

BoJack: I guess what I'm trying to say is, this mustang wants to rest his head in the comforts of your spacious barn.

Naomi: Uh, what?

BoJack: I'm in love with you, Naomi.

Naomi: BoJack, they fired me and replaced me with a ball on a stick.

BoJack: I'm so sorry. But look at the bright side. Now you and I can just hang out and talk about feelings.

Naomi: No, but you're not getting it. Boys never get it. BoJack, I was in character as Diane, and as Diane, we had a real connection. But now that I'm off the movie, I'm Naomi again, and Naomi is not interested in BoJack Horseman. In fact, she thinks he's kind of gross.

BoJack: So I didn't fall in love with Naomi Watts?

Naomi: No. You fell in love with Diane.

BoJack: Naomi Wa-a-atts?

Naomi: Good-bye, BoJack. (kisses him) Ugh. See? Nothing.

BoJack: What's going on? Why are they packing up?

Quentin: Oh, glad you're here. This is exciting. Since we last talked, this film has gone through so many permutations.

Todd: So many.

Quentin: First, we reimagined the whole film as an interactive social media experience.

BoJack: Those are the dumbest words I've ever heard.

Quentin: I know. So we realized it was actually more of a floating art installation, but that didn't feel right either.

Todd: We thought, is it a high-end perfume?

Quentin: A series of interrelated fortune cookies?

Todd: A hat that if you turn it upside down, it's a boat?

BoJack: No, it's none of those things.

Quentin: Exactly. That's why we finally settled on this. Voila!

BoJack: What am I looking at?

Todd: It is a bimonthly curated box of snacks.

BoJack: I don't know what that means.

Todd: I know. It's confusing. Not the bimonthly that means twice a month, the bimonthly that means every other month, and each time it's a different box of snacks.

Quentin: This is the future of cinema.

Mr. Peanutbutter: You guys, finally, my story has been told.

Quentin: Okay, that's a wrap, everyone. Thanks for making this box of snacks a reality. Let's go home.

Lenny: What the hell happened to the movie? Shit, there were snacks here the whole time? Not bad.

Todd: Whoa!

BoJack: Look, I get it. You destroyed my big chance at a comeback as revenge for what I did to your rock opera.

Todd: Revenge? Oh, that would have been such a good idea. Damn it, Todd! Look, I figured out what you did, but I've been trying to put it behind me and do my job.

BoJack: So cutting my part down was not about revenge?

Todd: No.

BoJack: And making BoJack the villain of your movie was not a coded statement of your feelings about me?

Todd: No.

BoJack: Oh, okay, great. Well, I'm.. I'm glad we buried the hatchet and everything's cool.

Todd: Uh, actually, you know, everything is not cool. You ruined my rock opera by using character actress Margo Martindale to trick me into playing an addictive video game. And saying it all together like that, it all sounds kind of ludicrous. But still, it was something I cared about, and what you did really hurt me.

BoJack: Oh. Well, this feels shitty. You sure you don't want to just get some revenge real quick thump me once in the stones and then we'll be even?

Todd: I got to go. I've got some artisanal popcorns to gauge the mouthfeel of.

Man One: Hey, BoJack.

BoJack: Yeah?

Man One: You want an apple fritter?

BoJack: Uh, sure.

Man One: Yeah, I bet you would. I bet you'd like an apple fritter.

BoJack: Yeah, an apple fritter would be great. Why? Wh—What—What's happening here? ("BUZZFEED. Dark Horseman:") "Five Shocking Facts From New BoJack Book." (1.Fritter Fanatic...)"? No. No! Um, everyone, please turn off your Internet. It has gone bad. I repeat, the Internet has gone foul.

Woman: What a loser.

Man One: I'm glad I'm not that guy.

BoJack: Give me your phones. I'm a celebrity. You have to listen to me.

Man One: Look at his deep well of sadness. It's hilarious.

BoJack: Don't look at me. I'm well-adjusted. You all want my life.

Uh, what the hell?

Diane: I know, I know. But if you just listen for..

BoJack: You posted your dumb little book on the Internet.

Diane: No, I just leaked the first couple chapters, and people are already talking about it.

BoJack: This is wildly unprofessional. Who do you think you are?

Diane: I know you're mad, and you have every right to be, but you got to read some of these comments. People love you. And they're gonna love you even more when they read the rest of my book.

BoJack: Your book?

Diane: Our book.

BoJack: Nobody is gonna read that book. How do you still not get that? It is never going to be published.

Diane: BoJack, I stand by my work. This is a really good book. And if you just give it time, you'll see.

BoJack: Maybe you're right.

Diane: Really?

BoJack: No. You're fired. 

Bird: Whoa!

BoJack: Okay, how about this one? "BoJack swallowed a dozen pastries in the time it took the caterer to unwrap a fruit tray. When she asked where the pastries had gone, BoJack claimed he had no idea, spraying her with bits of buttery crust?"

Pinky Penguin:" World's 3th best dad" (laughing) I did that once. But with holiday cookies. I had sprinkles all over my sweater.

Diane: See? People respond to the flawed portrait I painted of you. They see themselves in it. Why do you love Secretariat?

BoJack: Uh...because he was awesome?

Diane: No, because he was flawed. BoJack, when people find out that someone like you, who seems larger than life, is actually just as wounded and vulnerable as they are, it makes them feel less lonely.

BoJack: Ugh, no! Maybe that's what flawed, sad fatties want from other celebrities, but for BoJack Horseman, they want a heroic horse-stud who is awesome and who can save them from their flawed, sad, fatty lives.

Diane: You're so wrong.

BoJack: Actually, you know what? Now that I think about it, I think that you're so wrong!!

Pinky: Listen, we all agree Diane broke the contract by leaking the first two chapters, but the response has been amazing! People want to read more, and we have to get this to the printers by the end of the week, because that's when the repo men are coming to take away our printers.

BoJack: The end of the week? No! Okay, what if I told you that I could have a new book for you by then?

Diane: What?

BoJack: Yeah, a better one. Better stories, better told, by me straight from the horse's mouth.

Diane: You're gonna write a whole book in five days? When's the last time you even read a book? The Firm, by John Grisham?

BoJack: Do you think what you do is so-o-o ha-a-rd? "I'm a writer. I go to coffee shops with my laptop and my notebook and my dumb glasses that I have to wear, because I'm so important I need to see clearly."

Diane: Well, I wish you the best of luck.

BoJack: You know what your problem is? You think you're so much smarter than everybody. Well, guess what. I spent as much time with you as you did with me. Why don't I write a book about how you married Mr.Peanutbutter because he's too dumb to see how much better you think you are?

Diane: Okay, I know you're upset—

BoJack: I'm not upset. I'm just sick of nerd-girls like you beating up on stars like me. It's pathetic! I'm sorry no one wanted to date you in high school, Diane, but I don't see why I have to suffer just because you were never especially pretty or interesting.

Diane: You really let me down, BoJack.

BoJack: You really let me down. I apologize for her outbursts.

Pinky: So, you really think you could write a better book by Friday?

BoJack: Damn right I can, so you can throw this turd of a book in the garbage and then light the garbage on fire. In fact, you can burn all books, because my book, written by me, is gonna kick your dick off.

BoJack: Okay, chapter one. Hmm...not quite right. What?

Princess Carolyn: (on the phone) Why are you rewriting the book, bozo? Diane's version is great. You're gonna lose gems like this one: (excessive throat screeching noises) ay-hem. "The only longstanding relationship in BoJack's life is with his agent, Princess Carolyn. Her loyalty must come from a deep-rooted faith that she's talented enough to sustain the career of a man society perceives as a joke."

BoJack: Yeah, I would say that I'm not such a fan of that one.

Princess Carolyn: Look, all publicity is good publicity. That guy who killed all those teachers and ate their fingers? He just got married in jail, and when this book comes out, you could be that guy.

BoJack: Egh, don't you get it? This is my last chance to make people love me again. If this goes out, everybody's gonna see the real me. Now, I spend a lot of time with the real me, and believe me, nobody's gonna love that guy.

Princess Carolyn: Okay.

BoJack: Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go take a shower so I can't tell if I'm crying or not.

BoJack: All right, let's get to work. (knuckles crack) I feel like we can beat this font. Ah, Copperplate, a font for the truly modern man. Ha. No. There you are, Verdana. Thought you could hide at the end of the alphabet, did ya'? Oh, Comic Sans, you drunk, go home. 3:10?! I just spent six hours playing with fonts? Holy shit! Okay, focus BoJack, focus. Here comes the focus. Well, this can't be that hard.

Diane's voice-over: "BoJack often felt the need to impress me with material items."

    FLASHBACK 

BoJack: You can see from the teeny, tiny brush strokes, that this is very expensive. The color is, um This one they don't even have a name for, that's how exclusive it is, and this..

Diane's voice-over: "I wondered where this came from. There were two obvious suspects. His mother Beatrice, heiress to the Sugarman Sugar Cube's fortune and used to certain comforts, and his working-class father, Butterscotch Horseman, who struggled, and often failed, to provide those comforts. Or, maybe it was something even.."

BoJack: Puu-uhh-hh! Puu-uhh-hh! Hey, Todd, Todd!

Todd: What? What?

BoJack: Todd! Todd!

Todd: What? What?

BoJack: Eyeballs here Look at me. Look at me! I need to work. I can't afford to be distracted. Don't distract me.

Todd: Fine.

BoJack: Egh, Jesus, Todd! Read louder much?

Todd: Sorry.

BoJack: Oh, sure, just drop Toaster Strudel crumbs all over the floor, why don't you? Guess I'll just clean them up myself, like always. I can't work like this. Come on, come on, come on, pick it up, you dumb vacuum. I do not have time for this. I need to write. What the.. Come on! Seriously? You cannot be seriou.. God, why are you keeping me from writing?!

BoJack: My parents loved me so much, it was crazy. I remember one Sunday afternoon, my mother said, "Your father and I want to spend quality family time together. All the kids in school envy your intelligence and kickball ability. Here's an ice cream sundae." No, wait. "An ice cream sandwich." No. "A dreamsicle." Egh, no. I don't know. This is dumb.

Butterscotch: Nice writing, Shakespeare.

Young BoJack: What did I do?

BoJack: Just need something to help me focus. Coffee. No, no. Cigarettes. No, tequila! No, I just need the right music.. to do drugs to.

BoJack: Sarah Lynn, I know things got kind of out of hand last time when I tried to make you stop doing drugs. So I just want to thank you for coming over this time to give me drugs.

Sarah Lynn: Well, you can't go wrong with Dr. Hu's drugs. They're from another dimension.

BoJack: These are gonna help me focus and get work done, right?

Dr. Hu: Oh, Yes. These are what I give college students so when they come to, their term papers have written themselves.

Todd: That's exactly what he needs. Also, I should probably do another one.

BoJack: Oh, it's "Hu." Dr. Hu.

Dr. Hu: That's right, Dr. Hu. Dr. Allen Hu.

BoJack: No, no, no, but I thought it was "Who," like Doctor Who.

Dr. Hu: Yes, that's exactly what it's like.

BoJack: No, not H-U, but, "who," like, "Hello, who is it?"

Dr. Hu: I don't know. Who is it? I'm sorry, is this a joke? Is he telling a joke? That I just don't—

Sarah Lynn: Hard to tell. Sometimes I just laugh after he talks so he'll leave me alone.

BoJack: Seriously? Am I the only one who knows the extremely popular BBC science fiction show about the time traveling doctor who saves civilizations?

Todd: Uh, yeah. I know what you're talking about Doctor Who.

Dr. Hu: Yes?

BoJack: No. Yes, thank you. Doctor Who.

Dr. Hu: Yes?

Todd: I saw the one where she goes to the Wild West. The Cheyenne called her Medicine Woman.

BoJack: What? No, that's Dr. Quinn.

Todd: Who's Dr. Quinn?

Dr. Hu: I most certainly am not.

Sarah Lynn: Hu's not Dr. Quinn? Hu's Dr. Hu?

Todd: I don't know.

Sarah Lynn & Todd: Third base!

BoJack: When are these drugs going to kick in?

Dr. Hu: Any minute now, if they haven't already. I want you to take three of these every hour and take two of these every 1/2 hour. Whatever you do, don't take more than four of these every 90 minutes, and take the first two of the three before you take the second two of the four. And don't expose yourself to bright light or get wet.

BoJack: So Gremlin rules?

Dr. Hu: Exactly! Well, I'm off to perform child heart surgery. Wish me luck.

BoJack: All right, team, focus up. We got a book to write.

    LATER 

Sarah Lynn & Todd: Yeah, yeah. My God, this is so good. It's good. So good, so good.

BoJack: Okay, Todd, how is it going with the heartwarming anecdotes?

Todd: Great! I'm writing about that time we officially became best friends.

BoJack: Nice! Can you change best to pretty good? Sarah Lynn, how's it coming with the Horsin' Around years?

Sarah Lynn: Almost done with the story where Hulk Hogan guest starred and told us to say no to drugs.

BoJack: Great. Keep typing, monkeys. (Blackout) If only Hulk Hogan could see us now, right?

Todd: What?

BoJack: Because Sarah Lynn said the thing about Hulk Hogan?

Sarah Lynn: That was like four hours ago.

BoJack: Oh, right. How we doing now?

Sarah Lynn: Sending.

Todd: Just about to send.

BoJack: Nice. Okay, this is great. That puts us at 216 pages? Holy shit, that's almost as long as The Firm by John Grisham.

Todd: And we just needed to get to 200, right?

Sarah Lynn: I'm just gonna keep writing. I got a lot of synapses firing right now.

BoJack: It's surprisingly literate and insightful, but still fun. It's a beach read you can thumb through in a wing chair. Can't believe Diane thought this was so hard. "Oh, my fingers are cramping from all this typing. It's like they're having their period."

Todd: Did Diane really say that?

BoJack: No, but my fingers are cramping. It's like they're having their period, am I right?

Sarah Lynn: (forced laugh)

BoJack: Are you just laughing so I'll leave you alone?

Sarah Lynn: (forced laugh) Good one.

BoJack: We just need a way to end this thing. What should the ending be?

Todd: Maybe it was Earth all along.

BoJack: Not that, but something like that. Keep thinking. (Blackout) I got it! Did you guys switch clothes?

Sarah Lynn: No.

Todd: (talking backward)

BoJack: Er—What—Huh—?

Sarah Lynn: I don't know. I like your idea better, BoJack.

BoJack: What?

Todd: Your idea for the ending.

BoJack: Oh, what'd I say?

Todd: About Maine. About how you end up in Maine.

Sarah Lynn: I like the part where you swim in the lake in the summers.

BoJack: Yeah, right, and when I get too old to take care of myself, I go for one last swim. I know I can't make it back to shore. I'm too weak, too tired. So I just let the water take me under.

Todd: Eesh! Downer ending.

BoJack: You got something better?

Sarah Lynn: Wait a minute. Maybe we don't know the ending yet because you haven't lived it.

Todd: Yeah, I mean, if you want to, like, finish finish the book, then you'd have to, like, die tonight.

Sarah Lynn: I know! I should murder you. ... I'm serious. Think about it. If the little girl you raised on television killed you in real life (gasps) people would eat that shit up.

BoJack: I love it. It's perfect. We'll sell so many books.

Todd: Oh, yeah. Yeah, kill BoJack!

Sarah Lynn: I'm gonna kill you!

Todd: Yes! There it is! Yeah, gonna get you!

    (all yelling) 
    (ominous rock music) 

BoJack: No, no, no, no

BoJack: Okay, so what did we learn? We learned that if we're going to do drugs we should do them at home where it's safe to do them together, right, Todd?

Sarah Lynn: No!

BoJack: Don't worry, guys. I have this gun to keep us safe from intruders. And each other.

Todd: Wait, wait, wait. Is that just your gun-shaped lighter, or your lighter-shaped gun?

BoJack: Busted! It's just a lighter.

    (gunshot) 

ALL: Aah!

BoJack: Shit, I guess it's my gun. Then what'd I do with my lighter? And what did I give to that baby?

Todd: Ha, I have a gun, too.

BoJack: Don't be a Silly Billy. That's a broom. Wait, am I holding a gun? (Blackout) Todd, are you holding a gun or a broom?

Todd: I can't tell anymore!!

BoJack: I guess we'll just have to shoot them at each other at the same time to find out!

Todd: Okay!

BoJack: Todd, sh—Oh— Can I just say—Todd, Todd, I need you—I need you to shh. Listen, listen, Todd. Okay, just to be totally clear, we're shooting each other to determine whether we're holding guns or brooms, right? Not because you're still mad about the whole me sabotaging you with the rock opera and your live stream and suchety-such?

Todd: BoJack, shh, shh, okay, BoJ? Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet. As you know, I was hurt, but then I realized that's just how you are. You know, and maybe I just need to stop expecting you to be a good person, so that way, I won't get hurt when you're not.

BoJack: Oh—oh, Okay.

Sarah Lynn: Hey, this isn't fair. I don't have a gun.

BoJack: Sarah Lynn is right. You know, if we all had guns, then no one would need a gun, and we would all be safe. Oh my God. I think we just solved the gun crisis in America.

Todd: Let them eat guns!

    (fake gunfire) 

Todd: Bang, bang, pow, pow, yeah, wow!

Sarah Lynn: Let's celebrate by taking more drugs.

    (intense electronic music) 

Todd: Now we just have to solve the drug crisis in America.

BoJack: Easy! We'll take them all.

Todd: Yes!

Sarah Lynn: (laughing)

    TWO DAYS LATER 

Diane: BoJack?

BoJack: (groans, sniffs)

Diane: Hey, sorry. You okay?

BoJack: Yeah

Diane: Listen, I've thought about it, and you're right. Your memoir should be a representation of you. It's only fair you're happy with how you're portrayed.

BoJack: Really?

Diane: Yeah. And I want to help write a book we can both be proud of.

BoJack: Oh, my God. Thank you. Thank you.

    (kissing) 

Diane: Oh, Wha— Ooh!

BoJack: Are you okay?

Diane: Oh, no! (panting) Not this again! Ga-a-a-h-h-h!

BoJack: (yelling) What is happening?!

Diane: I ate too many pa-a-ancakes!

BoJack: Oh, shit, I'm still tripping.

    Actually, not two days later. Just two minutes later. 

Diane: (groaning, grunting) Kiss me.

BoJack: Oh, go— (whimpering)

    (Electrical crackling) 

BoJack: Ah—ah—oh! Oh, oh, ah, ah. (yelling)

BoJack: (sneezes, cries)

Herb: You abandoned me, and I will never forgive you for that!

    CUT, "Silver Spoon diner" 

Mr. Peanutbutter: I'm Mr.Peanut—I'm Mr.Peanut—I'm Mr. Peanutbutter.

BoJack: Oh, my God! (grunting, panting) What?

Mr. Peanutbutter: (deep voice) Hoo hoo hah hah hah—

BoJack: Ah! (thud) Whoa. What the— Whoa! Okay, stay calm. I don't have outlines anymore. That's okay. There's no boundary between me and space. This is a thing that happens. (groans)

BoJack: Shouldn't we help him?

Diane: No, he loves treading water.

BoJack: Oh—Oh, God. Oh—uh-oh. (whimpering) Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

    (shrill laughter) 

    (laughter, chatter) 

BoJack: Why is everyone laughing? What's so funny?

Herb: Cut! Get your head out of your ass, B.J. Your line is, "This is all I am and all I'll ever be."

BoJack: "This is all I am and all I'll ever be."

Ethan: "You can say that again (voice changes) old man."

    (echoing laughter) 
    (soft heavently choir) "Oh" 

Sabrina: Horse, horse, horse!

BoJack: What is it?

Sarah Lynn: Will you make me a penis butter and va-jelly sandwich?

BoJack: What?!

Sarah Lynn: I said, make me a penis butter va-jelly sandwich, bitch!

    (laughter) 

BoJack: No, no.

Todd: (voice) No? Well, isn't it too late to say no, BoJack? This is the road you chose.

    (laughter) 

BoJack: I'm sinking, somebody help. The floor is tar.

Charlotte: Why don't you come with me? Come to Maine.

BoJack: I can't, I'm stuck. Do they have Pinkberry in Maine? I can't!

    PAST 

Beatrice: Go out there.

Young BoJack: I can't.

Beatrice: Can't lives in a house on Won't Street. You will not embarrass me in front of the entire Supper Club. I told them you were going to sing the "Lollipop" song.

Young BoJack: But I don't feel like singing.

Beatrice: Nobody gives a damn what you feel. You've got an audience out there, and they want to hear you sing. Now, you want your mommy to love you? You go out there and you do the only thing you're good for, which is singing the goddamn Lollipop song. And let me tell you somethin'. The secret to living forever is..

Muppet Diane: Hey. What seems to be the problem?

BoJack: Good grief. I'm so depressed. I just want everyone to love me, but I don't know how to make them do it.

Diane: You can't force love, you blockhead. All you can do is be good to the people in your life, and keep your heart open.

BoJack: I screwed it all up. It's too late for me, isn't it?

Diane: I don't know. I'm just a crazy drug hallucination. I'll say whatever you want me to.

BoJack: Then tell me it's not too late.

Diane: Well, it's not too late. It's never too late.

BoJack: Yeah, that's right.

Diane: It's never too late to be the person you want to be. You need to choose the life you want. That'll be 5 cents please

    CUT, Winter 

BoJack: (grunts)

Charlotte: BoJack.

BoJack: Yes, dear?

Charlotte: Supper's ready.

BoJack: Ran into Ed at the hardware store. He said we're in for some weather. What the hell does that mean? "Some weather." We're always in for some weather. Guess what, Ed? There's never not weather.

Charlotte: (laughs) Oh, BoJack, don't.

BoJack: Come on, I can't help it. It's just so cute how they do it automatically. How do they know?

Charlotte: Mwah.

BoJack: Oh, man, can we just stay exactly like this for the rest of our lives, please?

Charlotte: Yeah, okay, sure, or we could do the opposite of that, because I'm pregnant.

BoJack: What? That's amazing.

Charlotte: Yeah, and I'm 80% sure it's yours. Mwah.

BoJack: Is it weird that I want to make love to you right now?

Charlotte: Why would that be weird?

BoJack: I don't know, it's— I don't want to spook the baby. Maybe we should just do mouth and hand stuff for the next nine months.

Charlotte: Mwah.

Harper: (gigling, cooing)

    LATER 

Young Harper: Daddy?

BoJack: Harper?

Harper: Where do the stars go?

BoJack: They're still there. We just can't see them because the sun is shining.

Harper: Oh, Daddy?

BoJack: Harper?

Harper: Do you think if you were a little kid, we would be friends?

BoJack: Well, that depends. Do you love cookies, and the color green, and braids?

Harper: Yes, I love all those things.

BoJack: Well, then, your application has been submitted and is pending board approval. Approved!

Harper: Wah! (laughing) Whoa!

Teenage Harper: No splashing! No. It's rough, don't. You're tickling.

BoJack: She grew up so fast.

Charlotte: I don't like that he drives a motorcycle.

BoJack: Honey, a Vespa is not a motorcycle.

Charlotte: (laughs) Okay, okay.

BoJack: What are you thinking about?

Charlotte: Oh, just how nice things could've been if you had chosen this life.

BoJack: Oh— What? Where? Hello?

Princess Carolyn: BoJack, I read the pages you sent me last night, and I have to tell you, your book is absolutely, without a doubt, the most— gibberish. It's gibberish.

BoJack: What day is it?

Princess Carolyn: Let's see what you got here. You got 20 pages of Doctor Who erotic fan fiction, a recipe for soup, five different theories about how 9/11 happened, and a bunch of embedded YouTube videos that can't possibly be printed in book form.

BoJack: Okay, I gotta go.

Pinky: Again, Tori Spelling is not here, as I already explained. Tori Spelling's ghostwriter is here. This is a ghostwriter convention. How do you not— Okay, next question?

Man: Uh, yeah, this is for the whole panel. What's your favorite kind of ghost to write for?

Pinky: What?! No, they don't write for ghosts. That's not wha— Why did I think this would be a good idea? Does anyone have an actual question for someone on this panel? An actual question, or a gun, so I can shoot myself?

BoJack: Yeah, I got a question.

Pinky: Oh, thank God.

    (microphone feedback) 

BoJack: My question is for Diane. Look, I'm sorry about all the stuff I said about you earlier. We can publish the book you wrote. You're obviously a better writer than I am, and I don't actually even really care what the world thinks about me anymore. I just hated reading that book because I hated feeling like that's how you saw me. Because I guess you know me better than anybody, and if you think that— Um, I guess my question is, do you.. Do you think it's too late for me?

Diane: What?

BoJack: I mean, am I just doomed to be the person that I am? The The person in that book? It's not too late for me, is it? It's— It's not too late Diane, I need you to tell me that it's not too late.

Diane: BoJack, I—

BoJack: I— I need you to tell me that I'm a good person. I know that I can be selfish and narcissistic and self-destructive, but underneath all that, deep down, I'm a good person, and I need you to tell me that I'm good, Diane. Tell me, please, Diane. Tell me that I'm good.

    (Bird calling) 
    (Harper giggling distantly) 

Man: Hey, aren't you the horse from Horsin' Around? 

Dick Cavett: When we booked you for this show, you'd just won the Triple Crown, but then just this week, I open up the newspaper and look at this—"Secretariat Under Investigation." What am I supposed to do with that?

Secretariat: Maybe it's a different Secretariat. Ha ha ha ha. No, but seriously, folks, there is no truth to these allegations. I have never bet on horse racing, and I certainly did not bet on my own races. Although I did bet the network's gonna give your show back to Joey Bishop.

Dick: O—ho ho—kay. We get letters here on the show, and one particular letter, for you, actually, struck a chord with our producers. This is from BoJack H. BoJack is nine years old. BoJack writes, "Dear Secretariat, I am a horse just like you. I like to watch racing, and you are my favorite racer."

Secretariat: Smart kid.

Dick: "When I grow up, I want to be just like you, and I think I'm on the right track. Get it? Track, because horses run on tracks, and you are a horse, and I am a horse. Do you get it? Do you get my joke about the track?" Okay, there's a whole page of this.

Secretariat: Should I write him back and tell him I get it?

Dick: He goes on, "My question for you is, I am a good kid, and I like to play, and I like to go to school, but sometimes I get sad. What do you do when you get sad? How do you not be sad? Sincerely, BoJack."

Secretariat: That's a great letter. BoJack, when I was your age, I got sad. A lot. I didn't come from such a great home, but one day, I started running, and that seemed to make sense, so then I just kept running. BoJack, when you get sad, you run straight ahead and you keep running forward, no matter what. There are people in your life who are gonna try to hold you back, slow you down, but you don't let them. Don't you stop running and don't you ever look behind you. There's nothing for you behind you. All that exists is what's ahead.

    ONE MONTH LATER 

Man One: Good morning, Louisville. It's August 22nd, 1973.

Man Two: A sad day for the sport of horse racing. Secretariat banned for life from competition.

Man One: It's a disgrace is what it is. This is the '70s. You can't cheat in sports and get away with it.

Man Two: You know, I think it just goes to show you, you can be the fastest runner in the world, but you can't outrun the truth.

    (wind whooshes) 

Man Three: And traffic is jammed today coming into Louisville. Looks like some idiot parked his car on the bridge.

    "GOLDEN GLOBES: a totally necessary awards show" 

Mr. Peanutbutter: And the Golden Globe for Best Comedy or Musical goes to—BoJack Horseman, my friend, for his book One Trick Pony.

BoJack: Yeah!

Announcer: This is a first win for BoJack Horseman and his first appearance at the Globe ceremony since his forced removal in 1992 after he exchanged blows with Sir Paul McCartney.

BoJack: Wow, what an honor. I have to thank the Hollywoo Foreign Press. I feel like I should mention that my book was not a comedy or a musical. Do you guys actually watch the movies you give awards to? 'Cause I kind of get the sense that—Also, my book was not a movie. You do know that, right?

Mr. Peanutbutter: We're friends.

BoJack: Anyway, the response to this book has been incredible. These last three months have been really amazing. You know, a lot of people said to me, "You sure you want to publish this book? It's pretty personal." And I said, "If I can make just one person out there feel a little less alone, then it's all worth it." And they said, "That's really brave." And I said, "Well, I'm not one to call myself brave, but since you said it, yeah, I am." After-party at my restaurant!

    (cheering, applause) 

    ELEFANTE 

BoJack: Why did I say after-party at my restaurant? I do not want to throw a party.

Todd: It did seem unlike you. I'm gonna go get some cotton candy. You want some?

BoJack: No! (pause) Yes.

Princess Carolyn: There he is, man of the hour.

Vincent: Hello, other grown up.

BoJack: Ugh.

Princess Carolyn: Oh, cheer up, dummy. Your book is a huge success. Everybody loves you. You just won a Golden Globe. If you can't be happy tonight, maybe you'll never be happy again.

BoJack: I'm sorry, is that supposed to be encouraging? Because it's super-bleak.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Vincent Adultman how are things at the old nine to five?

Vincent: Good. I went to the stock market today. I did a business.

Princess Carolyn: I keep telling him he works too hard. Come on, Vincent, let's get away from the rat race. Take a cruise someplace wet and Latin. I mean, can you imagine this body in a swimsuit?

BoJack: I literally cannot.

Princess Carolyn: Vincent, let's do a lap. Have you met Brendan Fraser? I feel like you two would love each other.

Vincent: Whoa. Easy, easy.

BoJack: I got to hand it to Diane. This book has been everything she said it would be.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Yeah, she knows what she's doing.

BoJack: How is Diane? I haven't seen her since— Well, I haven't seen her in a while.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Well, the book's been huge for her, too. She's practically as famous as I am now. We're like the Brangelinas.

BoJack: Well, I'm happy she's happy.

Mr. Peanutbutter: And how are you?

BoJack: Well, it's been really hard—

Mr. Peanutbutter: Erica, is that you? Who let you out of the burn ward? Get over here, you.

BoJack: Uhh

Girl One:: ("I'M ZOE") Excuse me. I just have to tell you how much I love your book. It's so naked and honest and revealing.

BoJack: It is? Oh-oh

Girl One: I love the part about how you became famous so you could be constantly surrounded by distraction and wouldn't have to be alone with yourself. I thought that was a really profound observation.

BoJack: Oh, yeah, definitely. So profound. Hey, do you want to get out of here?

Girl One: What?

BoJack: Come back to my place, maybe get a little more naked, honest and revealing?

Girl One: Oh, no. No, thanks.

BoJack: What about you?

Girl Two: Yeah, okay.

BoJack:(groans) Oh—Whoa.

Girl Two: (screams)

BoJack: Huh.

    CUT, STORE 

Robin: Hey, Diane.

Blue Jay: You still friends with BoJack?

Robin: Heard you two were on the outs. You gonna write another book about it?

Blue Jay: You looking at some oranges? You gonna write a book about those oranges, huh?

Diane: Ugh. Hello.

Sebastian: Diane. Sebastian St.Claire here, famed billionaire philanthropist/adventurer. Please, hold your applause.

Diane: Okay.

Sebastian: Well, you can applaud a little.

Diane: Okay.

Sebastian: I got your number from Pinky Penguin. I'm looking for a journalist to follow me around for a few months and document my daring exploits aiding ravaged communities and displaced people. Ssss.

Diane: Wow, that sounds amazing. But that's not usually the kind of thing I write about.

Sebastian: Diane, if you can make people care about BoJack Horseman, surely you can make them care about emaciated orphans with missing limbs. We need to wake people up.

Diane: Well, I am a morning person.

Sebastian: I hope you mean mourning with a "u," because, Diane, this is deadly serious.

Diane: Oh, yes, of course.

    LATER, MR. Peanutbutter's HOUSE 

Mr. Peanutbutter: You want to spend three months in Sudan?

Diane: Not just there. We're also going to Haiti and Thailand and Uganda and Chechnya.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Can't you do all that in L.A.?

Diane: I want to do something important. I want to help people and do good work and sleep on the ground and poop in a bucket.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Honey, nobody wants to poop in a bucket.

Diane: Maybe I do. Maybe I want to poop in a bucket.

Mr. Peanutbutter: If you want to poop in a bucket, we can get you a bucket. You don't have to go all the way the Chechnylavakia. Am I saying that right?

Diane: It's not just the pooping in a bucket. I think it might be good for me to get out of L.A. for a little bit.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Sweetie, you know I support you, whatever you want to do, but you're not gonna find what you're looking for in these awful made-up places. The universe is a cruel, uncaring void. The key to being happy isn't a search for meaning. It's to just keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense, and eventually, you'll be dead.

Diane: Well, I guess I can keep my options open.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Great. (whistles gleefully)

    VIGOR 

Princess Carolyn: Hey, can I ask you something? Did Vincent seem extra weird to you last night?

BoJack: Well, he's still three kids in a trench coat, so, no.

Princess Carolyn: We're going through a rough patch. It's hard, you know. He works a full-time job at the business factory, so when he gets home, he just wants to unwind by watching R-rated movies. I thought I was ready for a real adult relationship, but—Enough about me. BoJack, you are on fire.

BoJack: Are we talking about me again?

Princess Carolyn: We have an offer on the table for you to play the bad guy in the new James Bond.

BoJack: Ehh.

Princess Carolyn: I agree. Total garbage. But this, it's a new drama from the Coen Brothers. A western about a one-horse town and you're the horse. Hello, Oscar. What do you think?

BoJack: I think now's the time to finally make "Secretariat."

Princess Carolyn: Really? Now? Aren't you a little, um, very too old?

BoJack: You asked me what I wanted to do. That's what I want. That's all I've ever wanted, and if I can't get it now, then all of this has been for nothing.

Princess Carolyn: Oh, fish. Of course! Why would you ever make things easy for me when instead you could make things incredibly difficult? Laura, clear out the rest of my day. I have to push a boulder up a hill, and then have it roll over me time and time again with no regard for my well-being.

BoJack: Attagirl.

    PB's House 

Mr. Peanutbutter: All right, Todd. PB Livin' needs a new project. Bi-Monthly Curated Box of Snacks has been an enormous success, but I got into this game to make movies, so let's make a movie.

Todd: Well, I got a stack of great scripts here. Anyone of them would make a wonderful movie.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Fantastic.

Todd: But, I also have this other non-movie-related idea.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Ooh, let's hear the other idea.

Todd: Okay. I was heading down Wilshire, and I saw this empty storefront, and I thought, "You know what this world needs?"

Mr. Peanutbutter: Edge of my seat over here.

Todd: A store where people can buy Halloween stuff.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Halloween store. Feel like that's been done.

Todd: Yeah, in October, but how come you never see a Halloween store in January? It's an untapped market.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Yeah. A Halloween store that's open year-round.

Todd: No, no. Just January.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Brilliant. That's the kind of idea that wins Golden Globes.

Lenny: I actually think the time is right for "Secretariat," so what do you want to play, like, Secretariat's dad or his grandfather, maybe like an elderly witch doctor who puts a curse on him or something?

BoJack: Lenny, look, I know I'm a little long in the tooth, but I think that you more than anyone would know not to count out an old pro.

Lenny: Don't play the ageism card with me, kid. I've laid farts that lasted longer than your entire career. But Secretariat was dead at 27, so who we kidding here?

BoJack: Just set the project up and give me an audition. That's all I ask.

Lenny: All right. You got yourself a "go" picture, kid. And by you, I mean me. And by "go" picture, I mean I'll make some phone calls, we'll see what I can do. And by "kid," I mean middle-aged adult.

Mr. Peanutbutter: (whispers) Shh. No, no, no. Put it here. Put it here.

Todd: Okay, I'll do it. Ahem. Has this ever happened to you?

BoJack: Has whatever happened to me?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Todd?

Todd: Yes, Mr. Peanutbutter?

BoJack: What's going on? Why are you talking like that?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Todd, I just got a phenomenal idea for a Halloween costume. Why don't you and I dash over to the store right quick and spend some hard-earned American money?

Todd: Oh, but, Mr. Peanutbutter, didn't you hear? It's January, and the Halloween store won't open for another nine months.

Mr. Peanutbutter: But I want satisfaction now.

Todd: Has this ever happened to you?

BoJack: Not to anyone ever at any time.

Todd: Ahem. We give you Halloween in January, a truly immersive Halloween experience for the rest of us.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Halloween in January? Please elaborate.

Todd: Okay, but before I do, tell the audience. Have we ever met before?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Never.

Todd: Well, according to facts, there's more suicides in January than any other month.

BoJack: Yeah, I'm getting pretty close over here.

Todd: Also, there's less Halloween stores. Coincidence?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Wow, I'm convinced. This store could save lives.

BoJack: Unbelievable. When your powers combine you are somehow even more stupid than the sum of your stupids.

Todd: Thank you.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Go on.

BoJack: You stop encouraging him and you stop encouraging him. The two of you are playing with fire.

Mr. Peanutbutter: A fire called Having a Good Idea.

Todd: Or maybe a fire called Friendship.

BoJack: Fires aren't called things.

Todd: What about the Chicago fire?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Or Fire Island.

Todd: Or Gabe.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Who's Gabe?

Todd: Just a fire I met once. Named him Gabe.

Mr. Peanutbutter: He sounds delightful.

Todd: He was. Good guy.

Mr. Peanutbutter: (groans)

    "CUT, ELEFANTE" 

Princess Carolyn: Business, business, business. Is that all you ever think about?

Vincent: I don't know.

Princess Carolyn: What's under that coat, Vincent? You need to let me in.

Vincent: Not right now. I have to call the guy at the office and take the car to the place.

Princess Carolyn: It's always guys in places with you. You know, I thought I wanted to date a real adult, but I'm actually young at heart. I need to feel the grass between my toes. I want to wear jeans. I want to dance.

Vincent: That's baby stuff.

Princess Carolyn: No, Vincent. There's more to being an adult than just work and business and the tall-person rides at Disneyland. I want to have fun. There has to be a difference between monogamy and monotony.

Vincent: What's mahumanunny?

Princess Carolyn: Well, clearly we had a different understanding of what this was. I'd like to be an adult about this, but frankly, I'm hurt. I think you should just go, just git. Get out of my life.

Vincent: Okay.

Princess Carolyn: Okay.

Vincent: Could I have another soda?

Lenny: BoJack, you know Kelsey Jannings, our director.

BoJack: I really appreciate you giving me this opportunity.

Kelsey Jannings: Yeah.

BoJack: Secretariat was kind of my hero as a kid.

Kelsey: Yeah, he was a lot of people's hero.

BoJack: Well, you know, here was a guy who had everything—

Kelsey: Yeah, I know the story. I'm the director.

Lenny: Kelsey, be nice. She's just cranky because she's already seen thirty people read for this today, and we are all so goddamn sick of seeing auditions, so whenever you're ready. Just jump right in.

BoJack: Great. Let's get to it.

[reading lines]

Woman: (stilted) Hey, ain't you that horse that won all them races?

BoJack: "Not today, ma'am. Today I'm just a customer who wants a warm slice of pie."

Woman: "Can I ask you a question? When you're out there on that there racetrack, what are you running from?"

BoJack: "You want to know the truth? Nothing."

Woman: "Everyone's running from something, sugar."

BoJack: "No, I'm running from nothing. I'm terrified of nothing. People come up to me, they want my autograph, they want my picture. They think they recognize something in me, and I want to be that person they think I am, but I'm not. They see a greatness in me, and they mistake it for goodness, but I— I know there's nothing there. As fast as I run, I can't get way from that."

Kelsey: Oh.

Lenny: Wow. BoJack, I think I speak for everyone when I say—

Woman: Oh, My God, Andrew Garfield said yes. We have our Secretariat!

Lenny: We got Andrew Garfield?

Woman: Oh, my God, it's the best day of my life.

Lenny: You don't say no to Spider-Man.

Woman: This movie is gonna be amazing! Wow!

BoJack: Andrew—Garfield!!!

    "CORDOVIA" 

Sebastian: Now, the pills will give you nightmares— I mean, just horrifying but the malaria will give you death, so you're going to want to take the pills, Diane.

Diane: Uh-huh

Sebastian: Hold on. A mosquito got into my tent. What do you want?

Diane: Hello?

Princess Carolyn: Diane, it's Princess Carolyn, BoJack's agent.

Diane: Yeah, I know who you are.

Princess Carolyn: I'm the pink cat, the one who used to date BoJack.

Diane: We've met a lot of times. You came to my wedding.

Princess Carolyn: Listen, the Turteltaub Company is making a movie about Secretariat. And since you're such an expert, they want to bring you on board as a character consultant.

Diane: What does that mean?

Princess Carolyn: It's the cushiest job in the world. You sit in a fancy chair and eat pastries all day. And then once a week, you say, "Oh, Secretariat wouldn't do that."

Diane: I don't know. I've already been offered this other thing. And did you know there are orphans in Sudan?

Princess Carolyn: Honey, you take this job, you can buy all the orphans you want.

Diane: No, I don't want to buy them.

Princess Carolyn: Look, if you really want to help people, it doesn't hurt to have a little money in your pocket. Take the job now, help the orphans later. There's always later.

Diane: Hmm

Princess Carolyn: Okay, talk it over with your husband. I got to go get my whiskers trimmed. I run into walls for days, but I look hot.

    "Silver Spoon DINER" 

BoJack: How's the pie here?

Waitress: Not good.

BoJack: Well, I'll take all you got. Screw it. Throw it in a bowl with some bourbon and bring me a ladle.

Waitress: Mm-hmm.

Todd: BoJack, we notice you've been pretty down in the dumps lately, but we have something that we think is going to cheer you up.

Mr. Peanutbutter: It's an exciting new business venture that's equal parts new and exciting.

BoJack: Another one? What happened to your Halloween store?

Mr. Peanutbutter: What now?

Todd: oh, right. The Halloween store. We took the floor out because Mr. Peanutbutter kept scratching up the hardwood, and then—Did we ever get the new floor installed?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Uh—

    "CUT" 

Guy: Halloween? In January? What a great ide— Aah! (thud)

Mr. Peanutbutter: Anyway, now we're all about smoodies.

BoJack: What?

Todd: Smoodies.

BoJack: You're saying smoothies, right? Smoothies.

Todd: No. Smoodies. It's a mood that you drink like a smoothie.

BoJack: I don't understand it. How do you drink a mood?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Like a smoothie.

BoJack: So it is a smoothie.

Todd: No, it's a smoodie—A mood that you drink.

BoJack: How do you drink a mood?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Like a smoothie.

BoJack: But do you buy it in a store? I mean, what're the physical attributes?

Todd: Look, we haven't worked out all the kinks yet, but the important thing is we've gone public, and we want you to get in on the ground floor.

BoJack: See, that's the problem with all your ideas they don't have ground floors.

    "CUT" 

Woman: Finally, a Halloween store for the rest of—Aah! (thud)

Guy: Hello.

Todd: Anyway, our launch party's tonight, and we'd love it if you came.

Mr. Peanutbutter: We spared no expense that's how confident we are in our product.

BoJack: Your product Smoodies.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Yes. Wait, did you say smoodies or smoothies? Because we only make— Which one do we make?

Todd: I'd like to think the smoodies make us.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Ahh, I can tell by your tone that that was something smart.

    (hip-hop music) 
    "SMOODEEZ" 

Girl One: Smoodie keychain?

Girl Two: Smoodie cozy?

Orca: Smoodie bottle opener? It's a mood that you drink like a smoothie.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Todd, it is all happening.

Todd: Hooray. And you know I don't throw that word around lightly.

Mr. Peanutbutter: All right. Now we just got to make sure we focus and actually follow through on this. I'd feel awful if this great idea fell apart because we got distracted by something else, as we are often wont to do.

Todd: Wait, did you say you feel awful or falafel?

Mr. Peanutbutter: I said, "Feel awful," but tell me more about this falafel idea.

Todd: Falafel or fawaffle?

Mr. Peanutbutter: What?

    (dance music) 

Princess Carolyn: BoJack, isn't this exciting? Smoodies, right?

BoJack: Do you even know what a smoodie is?

Princess Carolyn: I think it's some kind of an adult onesie. Whatever it is, I'm trying new things. I'm single again, and I'm loving it. Let me repeat—

Vincent: Princess Carolyn.

Princess Carolyn: Vincent. Well, you've got some nerve showing your face. I've got half a mind to—

Vincent: No, let me talk. I had a attitude problem, but then I took a timeout, and I thought about what I did. I wanted to be a big man. But sometimes the biggest thing a man can do is tell the truth. And the truth about me is, I—I—

BoJack: Okay, here we go.

Vincent: I love you.

BoJack: What?!

Princess Carolyn: Oh, Vincent.

Vincent: Let's go feel grass between our toes.

Woman: What?

Man: All right. You're a better man than I could ever be.

Woman: I wish my boyfriend was that mature.

BoJack: (groans) Hello?

Kelsey: (on the phone) BoJack, it's Kelsey Jannings. I got some news about "Secretariat."

BoJack: What's up?

Kelsey: Garfield's out. He got into some sort of accident.

Andrew Garfield: An All Hallows' Eve store in January? How fiendishly droll. Aah! (thud) Oh, bother.

Kelsey: The clumsy bastard broke every bone in his body, and now we got to find a new lead. Studio wants to go young, but I was thinking we'd get someone a little more BoJack Horseman.

BoJack: What? Are you serious?

Kelsey: You're the only one with enough grit to play the part, and we can age you down in post, but I'm gonna tell you now, not gonna put up with any woe-is-me bullshit or diva histrionics. I get enough of that from my ex-wife along with newspaper clippings about gluten. God, we get it, Marla. Gluten. But if you want to make a movie, and you're ready to work

BoJack: I am. I will. I can. I do.

Kelsey: Great. You got one month to get in shape. You need to lose 50 pounds and then gain back 20. And, BoJack.

BoJack: Yeah?

Kelsey: Don't ever call this number. If I want to talk, I'll call you.

BoJack: Hey.

Diane: Hey.

BoJack: Not big on parties, huh?

Diane: Nah. I never know what to do with my hands.

BoJack: I think I just got cast in Secretariat.

Diane: That's amazing.

BoJack: It's everything I ever wanted.

Diane: Yeah, you seem super-jazzed.

BoJack: What do I do now?

Diane: Well, that's the problem with life, right? Either you know what you want, and you don't get what you want, or get what you want, and then you don't know what you want.

BoJack: Well, that's stupid.

Diane: Yeah. I don't know if this makes you more or less excited, but I actually decided to take a job on the Secretariat movie as a character consultant.

BoJack: Wow, so we're gonna be working together again.

Diane: Yeah. I hope you don't get sick of me.

BoJack: I don't think that's gonna happen.

Diane: Is it weird I took this job?

BoJack: Why would it be weird? You literally wrote the book on Secretariat.

Diane: Yeah, I know. I just—When I first moved to L.A. I thought I was gonna be doing really important work. You know, writing stuff that makes a difference. But then you kind of fall into one thing and then another

BoJack: Well, you've got time. There's always later, right?

Diane: Yeah, I guess there's always later. Do you remember the last time I saw you? You asked me if I thought you were a good person deep down?

BoJack: Do I remember that? Yeah, vaguely.

Diane: You caught me off guard. I didn't know what to say.

BoJack: Well, do you think I'm a good person deep down?

Diane: That's the thing. I don't think I believe in deep down. I kind of think all you are is just the things that you do.

BoJack: Well, that's depressing.

Diane: (laughs)

BoJack: For what it's worth, I think your writing does make a difference.

Diane: Thanks.

BoJack: I really wanted you to like me, Diane.

Kids: Aha. Whoa.

Blake: Can you make it out to Blake?

BoJack: Uh-huh

Blake: Thanks, man. You're, like, my hero.

BoJack: Really? Huh. 

Dick Cavett: This is from BoJack H. BoJack is nine years old. "When I grow up, I want to be like you. I'm on the right track. Get it? Track? Because horses run on tracks and you are a horse. And I am a horse. Do you get it? Do you get my joke about the track?" There's a whole page of this.

Secretariat: Should I write him, tell him I get it?

Dick: He goes on. "My question for you is: I am a good kid and I like to play, and I like to go to school, but sometimes I get sad. What do you do when you get sad? How do you not be sad?"

Beatrice: Oh, big stud, running off to gallivant with your fillies. (plate smashes)

Butterscotch: Is that to impress me? 'Coz I can smash a dinner plate, too.

Beatrice: That's a salad plate, you peasant.

Butterscotch: What? I thought these were salad plates.

Beatrice: Those are saucers!

Butterscotch: Why do we even have saucers? We don't drink tea.

Beatrice: Those saucers are for entertaining!

Butterscotch: Oh, yeah? Well, I'm EXIT-TAINING!! Do you get it???!!!!!

Secretariat: But, uh, seriously, folks. (chuckles) Right?

Beatrice: (groans) Don't sit so close to the TV, it'll make you cruel. You know, I was beautiful before I got pregnant.

BoJack: (9yo) I know.

Beatrice: You ruined me, BoJack.

BoJack: I know.

Beatrice: You better grow up to be something great to make up for all the damage you've done.

BoJack: I will.

Secretariat: —and I just kept running. BoJack—

Beatrice: Okay, enough me being a great mom. I'm gonna go hide your father's heart medication. Enjoy your dumb little TV show.

"Old Dumb Life Brand-New Attitude by Andrew J. Hentz"

Andrew: (on recording) The first thing is, you gotta believe that change is possible. You have to tell yourself every day: "I can change and I will change."

BoJack: "I can change and I will change."

Andrew: "Louder."

BoJack: "I can change and I will change."

Andrew: "Still can't hear you."

BoJack: You're an audio-book.

Andrew: "I've got a brand-new attitude. That's what your face should be saying to everyone you pass on the street. We call that the PANTS approach. P-A-N-T-S. People all need to see."

BoJack: "People all need to see." Yeah, a little to the right. No, house right. That's an acting term. It means left. I'm an actor. (phone ringing, groans) No.

Todd: BoJack, why did I wake up in an alley?

BoJack: I had to get rid of the old couch, Todd.

Todd: While I was sleeping on it?

BoJack: The couch was a metaphor for my old attitude. My audio-book told me I had to let go of the burdens of my life sofa. Oh, you know what? Maybe it was "my life so far."

Todd: I still feel like you could've woken me up first.

BoJack: Todd, no one can wake anybody else up. You need to wake yourself up.

Todd: (sniffs) I don't know if I trust this new guy. I'm just gonna go sleep in your car.

BoJack: Uh-oh. I think someone needs a FAB.

Todd: A FAB?

BoJack: FAB, stands for fresh active BNA.

Todd: BNA?

BoJack: Brand-new attitude. Try to keep up. "ATTITUDE" stands for attention to—

Todd: Did you also get rid of my stuff? Where's my duffel bag?

BoJack: I value you. Hashtag "thank you for being a friend." Hashtag "PANTS." (panting)

Andrew: (on recording) "You got to conquer that hill. The hill is a metaphor. Everything is a metaphor. You are literally a metaphor."

BoJack: Oh, my God. Oh, my God, this is the worst. This feels awful. Why does anybody run?

Man: On your right.

    VIGOR 

Princess Carolyn: (on the phone) And she had no idea that her boyfriend was the strangler. I guess some people just see what they wanna see, right, Vincent?

Vincent: Um—Yeah.

BoJack: Hey, Princess Carolyn.

Princess Carolyn: I gotta go. One of my dumb-ass clients is here.

BoJack: Just out for a jog, thought I'd say "hello." I jog now.

Princess Carolyn: You jogged here from Laurel Canyon?

BoJack: Well, I drove here, but I moved my arm a bunch, so the Fitbit counted the miles.

Stuart: Uh, someone named BoJark Hoseman is here?

Princess Carolyn: Thank you, Stuart.

Stuart: Also, your coffee is coming late. Just like you ordered.

Princess Carolyn: I said "latte."

Stuart: Ah. Well, I wrote down "late," so that's what it's gonna be.

BoJack: What happened to Laura?

Princess Carolyn: Assistants are like Belushi brothers. The good ones leave too soon, and the bad ones never go away.

BoJack: It's a beautiful day, though, right? Every morning is a miracle. Hashtag "miracle." Hashtag "every morning." Hashtag "every morning is a miracle." Hashtag "BoJack thoughts."

Princess Carolyn: Well, I'm glad you found your bliss, BoJack, but are you ready for your first day on set tomorrow?

BoJack: You mean, am I amped? Because I am so pumped.

Princess Carolyn: This Secretariat movie is a big deal. Please do not blow it.

BoJack: Why would I blow it? I have a brand-new attitude. You know, when I won that Golden Globe last month, I went to a very dark place. I was in a hole. And I realized, "I can wallow in this hole or I can change." and while I was tempted to go with the former, sometimes the only way out of a hole is a latter. No pun intended.

Princess Carolyn: You clearly intended that pun.

BoJack: Princess Carolyn, you gotta believe in the AHP of TPE. Huh.

Princess Carolyn: Uh-uh. I'm not asking.

BoJack: The awesome healing power—

Princess Carolyn: I am not asking.

BoJack: —of total positive energy.

Princess Carolyn: Yeah, You should leave because I'm about to pretend to get a phone call. Hello? (chuckles) No, he's still here. No, he's not taking the hint somehow.

BoJack: Mm-hm.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Honey, where's my bandanna?

Diane: You chewed it up, we had to throw it away, remember?

Mr. Peanutbutter: No, not that one. The one with the bones on it. With the meat juice stains? The one I wore to The Emmys.

Diane: I don't know. I gotta go. BoJack's gonna be here any minute. Did you check the hall closet?

Mr. Peanutbutter: I can't see anything in this stupid thing.

Diane: I know, Mr.Peanutbutter. But the doctor says you gotta keep it on for one more week.

Mr. Peanutbutter: I look like an idiot.

Diane: You look very responsible.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Is the bandanna doing anything?

(doorbell rings)

BoJack: Heya, work buddy, first day on the job, huh? Hashtag "great day to start fresh at a new job, sincerely, BoJack." At Diane.

Diane: Still can't believe you wanted to carpool.

BoJack: Gotta save the planet, Diane.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Hey, is that BoJack Horseman? I really don't know because I have no peripheral vision. Going off of smell here folks.

BoJack: Mr. Peanutbutter, how the hell are you?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Loving it, buddy. Loving life.

BoJack: Brother, I am right there with you. I got a brand-new attitude and I am also loving life.

Diane: Uh—

Mr. Peanutbutter: Diane, look at us. A couple life-lovers over here.

Diane: Uh—

BoJack: Is that a new cone? Looking sharp, PB.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Oh, it is a new cone. Is it really obvious I'm wearing a cone?

BoJack: Didn't even notice. Because you've got the smile of a winner.

Diane: What's going on here?

Mr. Peanutbutter: I have to wear the cone so I don't gnaw on the stitches I had to get when I punched a mirror last week. I got drunk and thought my reflection was another dog. (laughs) I was so mad at that other dog. He was wearing my clothes.

BoJack: Hey, we've all been there.

Diane: I don't understand what's happening.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Did someone says something to the left of me? Diane, sweetheart, is that you?

BoJack: Hey, why don't we just us two schedj a hang for this 'kend? "'Kend" is how I say weekend now.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Uh, I love that. And I got a pair of tix to the 'Stones show this 'kend. Wanna go?

BoJack: The Rolling Stones?

Mr. Peanutbutter: What? Oh, no, no, no. The Mighty Mighty Bosstones.

BoJack: You know, I'm not really familiar with that outfit, but I do love trying new things.

Diane: Who are you?

BoJack: Anyway, we gotta get to work. It was really great talking to you, Mr.Peanutbutter.

Mr. Peanutbutter: All right, break a leg, good buddy. Diane, BoJack's ready to go. Where are you, sweetheart? Are you ready?

BoJack: Happiness is a metaphor—

Todd: Where are we going?

Diane: Oh, my God.

Lenny: BoJack, this is Corduroy Jackson-Jackson, your costar.

Corduroy Jackson-Jackson: Hey, man.

BoJack: Corduroy Jackson-Jackson. Oh, right, the underwear guy.

Corduroy: Underwear model/actor/dancer/dreamer. Also, you know, I'm a huge fan. I'm so excited/amped/pumped to be working with you. (chuckles) Yeah.

BoJack: Hey, man, that's fantastic/great/I-ran-out-of-things.

Diane: Hi. Kelsey Jannings?

Kelsey: That depends. Are you my ex-wife's lawyer?

Diane: I'm Diane. I'm here to be a character consultant.

Kelsey: What?

Diane: I got a call from the studio, they said—

Kelsey: Okay. Why don't you stand over there and make sure no one trips over that cable?

Diane: This cable?

Kelsey: Do you have a thousand dollars for me?

Diane: What?

Kelsey: Because each minute I spend talking to you, that's how much money I'm wasting.

Diane: Oh. Sorry.

Kelsey: Hey, who's this guy? Who lets this guy in?

Todd: I just er—

Kelsey: He's got a funny face. I like your face guy.

Todd: Thank you.

Kelsey: What a cute funny face. You wanna cookie?

Todd: Err—okay.

Kelsey: Can someone get this guy a cookie?! He's got a very soothing face and I like looking at it. it's Like a Matisse painting.

Todd: Whoa.

BoJack: Guys, could I get everyone's attention, please?

Diane: Oh, watch out for the cable. Don't trip over the cable.

BoJack: I just want everyone to know what an honor it is to be here. Secretariat has always been a personal hero of mine. It's a complex role that requires a precise touch and a deft hand and I just can't wait to tackle it head-on. It's truly an honor. Namaste.

Kelsey: Neat. So, in this scene, Secretariat's at his lowest. He just lost his first race, his father was sent to the glue factory. It's a dark moment.

BoJack: You got it.

Debra: Scene 22 alpha, take one.

BoJack: (inhales, then exhales)

Kelsey: Action!

Corduroy: "Hey, Secretariat."

BoJack: (campy, upbeat) "What are you doing here?" (chuckles, mumbles, then chuckles)

Kelsey: (groans)

Lenny: Ugh— (phone buzzing)

Diane: Hello?

Sebastian: Diane! I can't tell you how disappointed I am you're not here with me in Northern Cordovia. I'm incredibly disappointed. Boo! I didn't think I could do it, but I did it. I'm amazing!

Diane: Sebastian, I know you're doing important work. But I couldn't just drop everything and fly to the Third World. I just got married, and—

Sebastian: Diane. People are dying, and I'm witnessing it. And I need people to witness me witnessing it.

Diane: I know, and I'll be there in three months, as soon as I'm done on the movie. This is also important. In a way.

Sebastian: Well, lucky for you, there'll still be just as much famine and war and devastation in three months.

Man: I'm not dead yet.

Diane: Yep. Lucky me.

Man: We're still rolling, people.

Kelsey: So, BoJack, in this scene, Secretariat is sad, right? He's afraid he's gonna lose his scholarship.

BoJack: Oh, sure. Yeah, sad. Of course. Duh. (chuckles)

Kelsey: Okay, here we go. Action.

Corduroy: "Hey, Secretariat."

BoJack: (campy) "What are you doing here?" That was bad. I know that was bad. Let's keep it rolling.

Kelsey: I'll say when to keep rolling.

BoJack: Okay. "What are you doing here?" Did we get it? I can tell by your face that we didn't get it. All right, let me try again. "What are you doing—?" I'm sorry I am having trouble with the words. Is it okay if I play around with it a little bit? "When did you get here?" Sorry, no. Got it. Got it. Got it. Man, these lights are bright, huh? Can we kill these lights at all? Is that a—?

Kelsey: No.

BoJack: Okay, I'm sad. I'm sad. Acting sad. Secretariat is sad. Okay, here we go. I'm sad! Sorry, what was the line?

Diane: I don't know if this helps or not, but when Secretariat was a kid—he actually—

Debra: (trips over the cable) Aah! My face!!

Man One: Hey, hey.

Man Two: Whoa, whoa!

Debra: Oh, my God.

Man Three: Watch out!

Man Four: Hey.

Man Five: (gasps)

Man Six: Whoa, whoa!

Debra: Oh, my God. My face! My beautiful face! Why didn't someone tell me not to trip over that cable?! It was such an important job, but no one was there to do it and now my face is in ruins!!

Kelsey: Okay, we're gonna need a couple of days to rebuild this set. So, let's all just use this time to regroup and really figure out what we're doing and why we're here.

    FLASHBACK (audience laughing) 

The Horse: So, let me get this straight. "Bad" means "good"?

Olivia: Maybe you should leave the teen-talk to me. Jeezy Kableezy.

(audience laughing)

    LATER 

Beatrice: Well, it wasn't Ibsen.

BoJack: That's your takeaway? That your son's TV show wasn't Ibsen?

Beatrice: I'm sorry. Did you need a compliment?

BoJack: That's—

Beatrice: Oh, I loved the part where you got your head caught in the banister.

BoJack: Yeah it's—

Beatrice: And what's this letter I have? It's from the government saying, "I'm proud of you."

BoJack: Are you—?

Beatrice: Oh, no, what actually I'm holding is nothing.

BoJack: Excuse me, can you check on our drinks? I would love some gin right now.

Beatrice: I wouldn't drink anything out of an open container. This town is full of AIDS.

BoJack: Well, that's not—

Beatrice: You're a clown, you know that?

BoJack: And you've always been a pillar of support. Gin, please? Is there gin coming?

Beatrice: I'm here, aren't I? I suffered through that ordeal. You know, the man sitting next to me was wearing a T-shirt? A T-shirt, BoJack, in the theater!

BoJack: Yes, a T-shirt. That is the worst thing that's ever happened to anyone in a theater.

Beatrice: The T-shirt told me to "just do it."

BoJack: Here we go.

Beatrice: I don't know to what "it" the T-shirt referred but I will not be spoken to in that tone by an article of clothing.

BoJack: Vodka? Triple sec? Looking for any alcohol.

Beatrice: You don't know how lucky you are to have me. I hope you die before I do so you never have to know what it's like to lose a mother.

BoJack: well, as long as one of us dies, that's good enough for me. Can we please get some alcohol into my mouth?!

    NOW, BoJack's car 

Andrew: (on recording) "The past is past. That's why it's called 'the past.' Tomorrow is an opportunity. You can be big and proud and bang on your tom-tom drum or you can get in your boat and row. Tom or row. Tomorrow."

Diane: Hey, do you wanna talk?

BoJack: Talk? Why? Why would we do that? So you can put everything we talk about in a book and sell a million copies?

Diane: Wow. Uh—

BoJack: Sorry, that's what the old me would have said. The new me doesn't hold a grudge. (phone rings) No.

Diane: I gotta say, the new you seems a little on edge.

BoJack: What? Me? I'm as cool as The Fonz in a meat locker. That's a metaphor, Diane.

Diane: Actually, it's a simile.

BoJack: Goddamn it. (phone rings, it's PC) Oh, okay. Hello?

Princess Carolyn: (in VIGOR) Hey, small talk, small talk, small talk. Are you blowing it? I heard you're blowing it.

BoJack: What? Who told you that? Was it Todd? Todd!

Todd: Huh?

Princess Carolyn: You gotta turn this ship around, BoJ. If you don't— Hey, can you hold on a second sweetheart? I'm getting another call.

BoJack: Wha'?

Princess Carolyn: Well, if it isn't my friend, Rutabaga, the boy prince of the 26th floor.

Rutabaga: Carolyn. How are things all the way up on 27? Stomp once for good, twice for killing it.

Princess Carolyn: (does it twice)

Rutabaga: Killing. Give me some gossip. My wife is making me go to the opera tonight and I need something to distract me from the thought of a bunch of D-bags singing songs in German about their boners.

Princess Carolyn: Okay, you gotta keep this close to the vest but I am inches from getting Emily VanCamp the lead in Goose Van Sant's new movie about Jackie O.

Rutabaga: My clients would've lo-huh I-ip if I got them parts like that. You're seriously killing it in the department of kicking ass in regards to you being an agent and being good at it, {vis-a-vis} crushing it.

Princess Carolyn: You're not so bad yourself, Rutabaga, for a 26er.

Rutabaga: You're the only one in this building who isn't a total snooze-cooze. Yes, Natasha, I'm talking about you. I know you're listening. Ugh. I gotta go. I made Natasha cry.

Princess Carolyn: (chuckles)

    BH's car 

BoJack: Yeah, I don't think she's coming back this call.

Todd: Could we keep it down in the front, please? Thank you.

BoJack: What am I gonna do?

Diane: Well, you were an actor for nine years on Horsin' Around. How did you do that?

BoJack: Uh

    1988 FLASHBACK 

BoJack: Hey, Herb, can I talk to you for a minute?

Herb: Of course, buddy. I always have time for you, my good friend BoJack in this, the year 1988. Have a seat. Hey, enough with the stomping already!

BoJack: Am I— Am I a clown?

Herb: Oh, brother. Didn't I tell you not to invite your mom to the taping? As Max Headroom would say, "Your m-m-mom is a b-b-bitch."

BoJack: But I am a good actor, right?

Herb: BJ, I don't know. Look— You know what you're good at? Hitting your mark, saying your lines, loudly with good diction.

BoJack: But should I be doing more? To capture the character and make the audience connect to its feelings?

Herb: This is a situation comedy. No one watches this show to feel feelings. Life is depressing enough already. You bring joy to millions of people. Maybe someday later, you'll need to learn how to act for real. But for now, don't worry about it. (chuckles)

    NOW, BH's car 

BoJack: Oh, shit. I'm not an actor. All this time, I assumed there was more to me than everyone thought but maybe there isn't. (PAUSE) That's the part where you're supposed to disagree with me.

Diane: Oh, right. Well, you got the part, didn't you? What did you do in the audition?

BoJack: Well, how should I know? That was the old me. Now I've got a brand-new attitude. Oh, God. Okay. Okay. What should I do? Make a break for it? Drive to Mexico? Start a new life there? Meet a local girl? Fall in love? Talk my way into a job at a textile plant? Gradually work my way up until I own the place? No! What am I talking about? I can't run a textile plant, that's way too much responsibility. Oh, What am I gonna do? The walls are closing in!

Diane: BoJack, breathe. You can do this. You have two days. Maybe you could hire an acting coach.

BoJack: Yeah?

Diane: Yeah. Plus, you can watch old Secretariat videos. I've got a hard drive full of research.

BoJack: Yeah. Yeah, you're right. You're right. I can do this. I've got two whole days. And when the pressure's on, that's when I shine. Yeah. Two days. I can do all those things.

    TWO DAYS LATER... BH's car 

BoJack: Oh, shit. I didn't do any of those things.

What are you doing here?

Kelsey: Ah! That was it. Say that again.

BoJack: (campy) "What are you doing here?"

Kelsey: Okay.

BoJack: No?

Lenny: BoJack, before we get started I wanted to show you this.

BoJack: What is this?

Lenny: This is the machine that's gonna make you a good actor.

BoJack: Really?

Lenny: No dummy. We just need to make a scan of your face so that if you die, we can finish the movie without you.

BoJack: what?

Lenny: Standard procedure these days. When a star is assessed to be of certain liability, like say if there was a whole book written about what a reckless jackass he is, you make a digital replica of his head, so you're not screwed if he goes all Belushi on you.

BoJack: Wait, which Belushi?

Man: Hold still, please. (whirring) Terrific. We got it.

Lenny: You know, one day, that's gonna be the actor's whole job — just sit in a room for five seconds while a machine scans his face and then six months later, plugging a movie on Kimmel.

BoJack: I gotta go on Kimmel now too? What if he makes me read a mean tweet? I'm not emotionally prepared for that.

Lenny: Don't worry so much. If you can't do this part we'll just fire you and get someone else who can. Either way, I'll be fine.

BoJack: (groans)

Kelsey: What do you need, BoJack?

BoJack: I don't know. I thought I wanted this, but now I'm feeling all this pressure. Do you think you made a mistake, hiring me?

Kelsey: I don't make mistakes, BoJack. I do the crossword in Sharpie, and I never learned the shortcut for undo.

BoJack: It's Command-Z.

Kelsey: Don't need it, won't use it.

BoJack: I'm trying to have this brand-new attitude, you know, be this better, more positive guy, but I just keep thinking about how this movie is my last shot at happiness.

Kelsey: Well, BoJack, I hope this helps: I don't care if you are happy or not. You have a job to do. (Todd enters) This guy again? I'm in love with this kid. I wanna put you in my pocket. You're adorable.

Todd: Aw.

    CUT, "Debra's Face" (man sobbing) 

Lenny: Hey, Diane, you're a writer, aren't you?

Diane: Yes. Yes. I am a writer. What do you need?

Lenny: Can you write on a sign "watch out for cable"? I know you were telling people that, but it's a really important job and a sign is less likely to get distracted.

Diane: Oh. Yeah. Okay.

BoJack: "What are you doing here?" "What are you doing here?" "What are you doing here?" What are you doing here?

Mr. Peanutbutter: So, I went a little overboard and I made you two mixes. The first CD is all Mighty Mighty. The second CD is all of the Bosstones' side projects and solo singles. so you can Listen to it and imagine the band never took that hiatus in the mid-aughts when America briefly lost interest in ska.

BoJack: What?! I don't have time for this. I don't wanna listen to your music. I don't wanna hang out. Get the hell out of here.

Mr. Peanutbutter: All right. You don't wanna listen to Bosstones together. That's the impression that I get. Is it the impression that I get, tho'?

BoJack: Yes. That's the impression that you get.

Mr. Peanutbutter: I see. Way to go, Mr.Peanutbutter. What a stupid move. Why did you- -?

Todd: BoJack, listen, I know you're scared, but it's gonna be okay. You gotta be strong.

BoJack: Yeah, but—

Todd: You gotta rise to the occasion, okay? So what if the new couch is weird? Or lumpy?

BoJack: Uh, what?

Todd: What are you gonna do? Just sleep in BoJack's car forever?

BoJack: Are you talking to me, or you—?

Todd: Damn it, time to stop being a coward. It's time to go home and sleep on BoJack's couch. Hurray! Happy ending for Todd!

Princess Carolyn: Charley. Listen, I wanted to touch base about Emily's start date on Jackie O.

Charley: Oh, yeah. Uh Well, we got some new screen tests and, uh, Goose decided to go in a different direction.

Princess Carolyn: Are you saying the Van Sant camp wants to recant on VanCamp? Because they can't.

Charley: Uh

Princess Carolyn: Charley, you better get your client to change his mind or I'll walk up to the 28th floor and —

Charley: Just kidding. I can't get to the phone right now.

Princess Carolyn: What?

Charley: This is one of those answering machines that sounds like it's Charley talking but it's actually just an answering machine.

Princess Carolyn: I know you're there, Charley.

Charley: Leave a message.

Princess Carolyn: I'm not gonna leave a message.

Charley: Beep.

Princess Carolyn: Hey, Charley, Princess Carolyn again. Listen—

Charley: Mailbox is full.

Princess Carolyn: What? Mailbox full?

Charley: Error. Message deleted.

Princess Carolyn: Wait— No—

Charley: Gotta go. Bye.

Rutabaga: Carolyn.

Princess Carolyn: Rutabaga, this is not a good time.

Rutabaga: Okay. Can I please just tell you about the opera, though?

Princess Carolyn: How did you like the opera?

Rutabaga: I loved it. Loved Tristan, loved Isolde, cried like a bunny. Listen, my brain has been a-buzzing for the past few days thinking about that Jackie O movie. I know it's your baby, but I did make a few calls and got my Rooney a screen test.

Princess Carolyn: I put that movie together for my client.

Rutabaga: No, no, no, don't freak out. It's just a screen test. But, honestly, how fantaj would my Rooney be as a young Jackie Bouv? Stomp once for so fantaj, twice for stupid-fantaj. Carolyn? I only heard one stomp. Oh. Carolyn, I heart you. You're beautiful. I wish I met you before I got married.

Andrew: "When you get your brand new attitude, you're gonna wave goodbye to the old— "

BoJack: What do you want, Mom?

Beatrice: Look who finally decided to pick up the phone.

BoJack: Do you need more blood?

Beatrice: I don't need blood. I read your book, BoJack.

BoJack: Oh.

Beatrice: It takes a real narcissist to think anyone wants to buy a book about him. You know how I feel about Anne Frank.

BoJack: That was a diary.

Beatrice: I read the parts about me. The things I said to you. You must think I'm a real monster.

BoJack: Mom—

Beatrice: I don't wanna fight you, BoJack. I just wanted to tell you I know. I know you wanna be happy, but you won't be, and — I'm sorry.

BoJack: What?

Beatrice: It's not just you, you know. Your father and I, we—Well, you come by it honestly, the ugliness inside you. You were born broken, that's your birthright. And now you can fill your life with projects—your books and your movies and your little girlfriends but—it won't make you whole. You're BoJack Horseman. There's no cure for that. Anyway, do you remember who directed The Philadelphia Story? Five letters, second letter U?

BoJack: Lubitsch?

Beatrice: No, BoJack. Goodbye.

Andrew: "You need to visualize it flying out the window, over the—"

BoJack: "What are you doing here?"

Kelsey: Great. We got it. Let's move on.

BoJack: So, at the end of the day, I'm just a regular guy trying to live a regular life.

Date One: Remember that time you peed in Drew Barrymore's car?

BoJack: Uh, yes, I remember that. Why do you remember that?

Date Two: It was in your book. You should do that to someone here.

BoJack: What?! No.

Date Three: Well, anyway, I can't believe I'm on a date with BoJack Horseman. I feel like that anonymous girl from Chapter 8 of your book mixed with the pluck and determination of that anonymous girl from Chapter 12 of your book.

BoJack: We don't need to dwell on the past.

Date Four: Wait, shut up. Is this the restaurant you bought when you were trying to show up Mr. Peanutbutter?

BoJack: Uh—No.

Date Five: Hey, this table's a little wobbly. You want to yell at the waiter and make a scene?

BoJack: No, I don't need—

Date Six: Come on, do that BoJack thing where you make a big deal and everyone laughs, but at the same time we relate, because you're saying the things polite society won't.

BoJack: That's not—Ugh—

Waiter: Is everything all right over here?

BoJack: No, everything is not all right. This table's been wobbling all evening. If I wanted to flop around and get seasick for an hour, I'd call your mother. (to a woman) Something in that area or?

Date Six: Take me home now and don't let me get out of bed until I turn horse-colored.

    BoJack's House 

BoJack: What are you doing?

Woman: Did you want me to stay?

BoJack: No, I wanted you to leave more quietly. Some of us here are trying to—

(Together, in unison) BoJack: forget you exist. Woman: "Forget you exist."

Woman: Classic BoJack. Love it. Oh, my God, are you Todd?

Todd: Uh, yes.

Woman: "Shut up, Todd!" (laughs)

Todd: Aw, okay.

BoJack: Hey, Todd, can you drive me to get my car?

Todd: Err—

BoJack: I wanted to be responsible last night, so I Ubered home and left my car in the fountain.

Todd: Sorry, BoJack. I gotta get ready for my grand opening. It's finally happening. My Disneyland.

BoJack: I realize that by saying "what" I might set off a chain of events whereby we continue this conversation, but what?!

Todd: Well, remember when I first moved in and I kept asking if we could go to Disneyland together?

BoJack: I do not.

Todd: And then you said that there was no Disneyland.

BoJack: No.

Todd: That Disneyland was a made-up lie, like the tooth fairy, that parents use to get their kids to behave.

BoJack: Oh, yeah, that shut you up.

Todd: Sure did. But then I thought: "Why isn't there a Disneyland? People would love it!" So, I took matters into my own hands, and over the last five years, I built my own Disneyland.

BoJack: You've been doing this for five years? How have you never mentioned it before?

    FLASHBACK 

Todd: Well, I bought that cheap plot of non-arable dirt by the toxic waste dump up the hill from the old fire station.

BoJack: Okay, Todd.

Todd: I'm gonna build a Disneyland.

BoJack: Sounds great, champ.

BoJack: (to Diane) —and if it wasn't for that, she never would've gotten sober.

Todd: Well, just finished drawing up blueprints for that Disneyland I'm building.

BoJack: Kind of busy here, Todd. (to Diane) So, it turned out to be a good thing I peed in her car.

Todd: Sorry for all the noise. Got this crew of worker bees to help me build my Disneyland.

BoJack: Okay, I get it. You are building your own Disneyland.

    NOW 

BoJack: Literally the first I'm hearing of this.

Todd: Well, anyway, tomorrow we open the gates. Finally, people will have a place to go after they win the Super Bowl.

BoJack: Okay, but you do know that there already is a Disneyland?

Todd: Yeah, I built it.

BoJack: No, I mean the real Disneyland.

Todd: You mean, the one in the hearts and minds of children everywhere?

BoJack: The one in Anaheim!

Todd: I think we're saying the same thing.

BoJack: Are we?

    HOSPITAL 

Doc: Well, I think it's safe to take the cone off. I can do it for a small co-pay.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Can't say I'll miss it, but we did have some crazy adventures together these last few weeks. Honey, would you rub my chin for me so I can remember things?

Diane: Oh, um, okay. Uh

Mr. Peanutbutter: Yeah, memories. Hey, where should we go for my first meal after the operation?

Diane: It's not an operation, but we could go to Storky's again.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Oh, yeah! We're finally due for our free sub. "Storky's, where your 81st sandwich is free."

Diane: We've been there 80 times? It just opened last month.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Yeah, but you love it, so whenever you suggest it, I always say yes.

Diane: Yeah, but 80 times?

Doc: Well, that'll be $6,000.

Diane: Ew--

Doc: Good thing you're getting a free sandwich, huh?

    BELLICAN'S 

BoJack: What the? —Huh? Okay, you guys. You vultures are killing me!

Vulture: I'm sure he's talking about other vultures.

    San FURNANDO Valley Skate 

BoJack: Ah, the Valley. Because sometimes you wanna go where no one knows your name.

Pinky Penguin: BoJack Horseman!

BoJack: Pinky? Hey, how are you?

Pinky: Oh, great!

BoJack: How's the book biz?

Pinky: Who knows? I jumped off that burning ship. Print media? What a joke. Now I got a job in broadcast network television, a booming industry with nowhere to go but up. Oh, God.

BoJack: What are you doing here?

Pinky: Oh, my boss loves this place. Do you know Wanda Pierce? Wanda just got named head of programming at MBN. We're here to celebrate. Well, that and she just woke up from a 30-year coma.

BoJack: Wait, she just got out of a 30-year coma and she's the head of programming at a major broadcast network?

Pinky: Well, she's been with the company 30 years. Everyone above her kept getting fired. Besides, she's got some really fresh ideas.

    FLASHBACKS 

Wanda Pierce: I am really feeling The Kirk Cameron Show. I don't even need a pilot. Let's just order 22 episodes. (applause)

Wanda: How about a new show where celebrities try to guess whether or not people have talent? We'll air it three nights a week. (applause)

Wanda: Okay, what if we got relevant superstar David Copperfield to make the World Trade Center disappear?

Pinky: Oh, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but David Copperfield really isn't a big draw anymore.

    NOW 

Pinky: Actually, everything feels fresh if you just forget the last 30 years ever happened.

BoJack: Huh.

D.J.: And here's a special request. I've never even heard of this song,"Special Feeling."

Pinky: Wanda, meet the one and only BoJack Horseman.

Wanda: Who?

BoJack: BoJack.

Wanda: Who?

BoJack: BoJack Horseman.

Wanda: Is that name supposed to mean something to me? Do you want to go skate?

BoJack: Nah. You know what they say, you can lead a horse to roller, but you can't make him rink.

Wanda: (laughs)

Pinky: What?

Wanda: That's really funny. You're funny.

BoJack: Really?

Wanda: Oh, my God. You should be on TV, which, holy shit, they're flat now.

BoJack: Actually, I was on. You know what, I'm sick of talking about me. Let's talk about you.

    LATER 

Wanda: Next thing I know, I'm waking up from a 30-year coma. So, now I'm sleeping on my sister's couch, but it's not ideal. She's molting. You know how sisters are.

BoJack: Oh, jeez, got a couple of curly guys in here with the regulars. How hard is it to look before they bring it out? Excuse me, miss?!

Wanda: I know, isn't it cool? Like we're getting away with something.

BoJack: What?

Wanda: Don't you love it when appetizers have a little crossover episode? It's like when you're watching Happy Days and Mork shows up.

BoJack: Oh, yeah, I guess. Or like when Kramer was on Murphy Brown.

Wanda: Who?

BoJack: Hey, you want to get out of here?

    BoJack's House 

Wanda: I don't want MBN to just be another boring old network, you know what I mean?

BoJack: Yes, totally.

Wanda: I want to take risks. I want to swing for the fences, you know? Otherwise, what are we doing?

BoJack: Oh, my God, is it morning? We stayed up all night talking, and we didn't even have sex.

Wanda: Well, it's not too late.

BoJack: Oh!

    Title Card: "A perfectly normal amount of time later for somebody BoJack's age" 

Wanda: That was fantastic.

BoJack: Oh, yes.

Wanda: Of course, I haven't had sex in 30 years. (Pause) I hope.

BoJack: Something's wrong.

Wanda: What is it?

BoJack: I don't know, I feel weird, like I want to spend more time with you even though I know we just had sex.

Wanda: Oh, okay.

BoJack: No, you don't understand. We already had sex, but I still want to spend time with you. Is that normal? Am I normal? What is happening to me?

Wanda: it's okay, We can spend more time together.

BoJack: I want to— do things with you. Fully clothed, sober, in daylight hours.

Wanda: Okay.

BoJack: I don't understand these feelings. Let's get food? Or walk in a park? Or—Oh, God, it's coming. I can't stop it. Do you want to go to Disneyland?

Wanda: Okay.

    Disneyland 

Wanda: Disneyland has a lot more sparking wires and loose nails than I remember.

Todd: Please hold your questions until the end of the tour. Here we have Mr. Todd's Wild Death-Coaster. The name is a work in progress, but we wanted to work "death" into the title for liability reasons. And this is Gabe Jr., the Grease Fire of the Caribbean.

Vincent Adultman: This is boring. I want to go home.

Princess Carolyn: Vincent, be nice! He's a little cranky because he just got adult braces.

BoJack: You mean, braces.

Vincent: Princess Carolyn, stop embarrassing me!

Princess Carolyn: Ugh.

Todd: And here we have Cinderella's magical pile of used mattresses.

Kid: Help!

Diane: Is it a good idea to keep all those mattresses so close to an active grease fire?

Todd: Where's your sense of wonder, Diane?

Wanda: Wow, your friend is really negative.

BoJack: Yeah, don't be so negative, Diane.

Diane: What?

BoJack: You know I hate negativity. I mean, I don't hate it because that's also negative, but you know.

Todd: Hey, Mr.Peanutbutter.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Hey, buddy. This place is amazing. It's like some sort of Disney version of Knott's Berry Farm.

Todd: Oh, that's exactly what I was going for!

Mr. Peanutbutter: I can't wait to get involved and really spray the old Mr. Peanutbutter scent on everything.

Todd: Uh, I was sort of thinking of this as kind of—just my thing.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Well, technically, you did build this while working for P.B. Livin, so I have the blah-blah-blah of first refusal or whatever.

Todd: Oh, uh, okay.

Mr. Peanutbutter: I mean, that's just good business. We're in this together now Todd, and nothing will distract me from—Erica! You can't be here. This place is filled with children.

    SET 

Man: "Coach said he saw you headed to the visitor's locker room with a steel pipe in your hand."

BoJack: "You really think I'm the guy who busted that pinto's leg? 'Cause if I am, you should be a lot more goddamn scared of me." — Hey! My girlfriend's here. Look, everyone! I have a girlfriend!

Kelsey: Sure. We'll cut there. The middle of your line is as good a place as any.

BoJack: What are you doing here?

Wanda: Just wanted to stop by. We're filming "Hey, I Think You Can Dance!" on the stage next door.

BoJack: Well, look at you, all professional. Like Natalie Portman in that movie where she was a professional.

Wanda: Who? People are watching.

Diane: Ugh. Of course, the first time BoJack dates a woman his own age, she's basically just a stunted 20-year-old.

Kelsey: Well, BoJack's stunted, too. He got famous in his twenties, so he'll be in his twenties forever. After you get famous, you stop growing, you don't have to. Every celebrity has an age of stagnation.

Diane: I'm glad I never got famous. I mean, I did write a best-selling book, but I'm not famous-famous.

Kelsey: Oh, it doesn't just happen when you get famous. Your age of stagnation is when you stop growing. For most people, it's when they get married, settle into a routine. You meet someone who loves you unconditionally and never challenges you or wants you to change, and then you never change.

Diane: But mostly it's just the famous people, right?

Man: Stella! Stella! Corona Light.

Wanda: This place is incredible.

BoJack: I wanted to make you feel at home, and nothing was bigger in the '80s than '50s nostalgia.

Wanda: It really feels like I'm back in the '80s, feeling like I'm back in the '50s. It's like if Back to the Future and Peggy Sue Got Married got married.

D.J.: Okay, teenyboppers, let's take things back to the '50s, '50s style, with this classic '50s hit that everybody remembers: "I Just Met My Perfect Match."

BoJack: Wanda, these last few days have been so amazing. You've given me a fresh start. In fact, it almost feels like I just woke up from a 30-year coma.

Alex: I'm sorry, did you say you just woke up from a thirty-year coma?

BoJack: Oh, no, not me. Her.

Alex: That's insane. I just woke up from a thirty-year coma.

D.J.: Whoa! Sorry about that needle skip, folks. Let's start that song again from the beginning.

Alex: I'm Alex.

Wanda: Wanda.

BoJack: And I'm BoJack.

Alex: You know, it's been really tough for me these last few weeks. I've never seen Home Alone and everyone makes me feel like a freak because of it.

BoJack: You've never seen Home Alone?

Wanda: I've never seen Home Alone! Also, I don't really know what a DVR is.

Alex: Neither do I!

BoJack: No one does. It's just a magic box.

Alex: Wanda, we have so much in common.

BoJack: Really it's just one thing. You can't count each individual thing as a different thing you have in common. That's like saying I have a lot in common with Kanye West because we both breathe air constantly.

Wanda & Alex: (Together, in unison) Who? Jinx. Buy me a Coke Zero. What's a Coke Zero? I have no idea.

Alex: We gotta hang out more. I didn't know there was anyone else like me.

Wanda: Give me your fax and pager number so I can add them to my Rolodex.

Alex: Tubular.

    BoJack's car 

BoJack: I don't trust that guy. I bet he's seen Home Alone.

Wanda: BoJack, I'm starting to lose the thread of your character. You think you can drop the jealous boyfriend routine? It feels a little done.

BoJack: You're right, I'm sorry. Call me Snoop Dogg because I will drop it like it's hot.

Wanda: BoJack, I don't— Oh, I got that one! Snoopy the dog. From "Peanuts." Okay.

    ALEX's House 

Princess Carolyn: Oh, I got here as fast as I could. Where's this next Haley Joel Osment you were telling me about?

BoJack: Oh, that was a lie to get you here.

Princess Carolyn: Aw, fish. There's never a next Haley Joel Osment.

BoJack: And there never will be. Sorry, I tricked you, but with Todd running his own Disneyland and character actress Margo Martindale in prison for some reason I don't remember, you're the best friend I've got right now. Now grab the binoculars. I need dirt on Wanda's new gentleman friend.

Princess Carolyn: No, BoJack. What's the play here? You'll find one little imperfection and harp on it forever like you do with my boyfriend?

BoJack: but You do understand what my "thing" is with your boyfriend, right?

Princess Carolyn: You're just gonna push her into this other guy's arms. Wanda likes you. Why ruin that?

Alex: This is Comrade Alexander calling KGB High Command. It's been two weeks since I woke up from deep sleep, and I still have not been contacted by my handlers. I am awaiting orders to take down the American dogs and pigs and other various animals and humans. Come in, KGB High Command.

BoJack: Slap my salami, the guy's a commie.

    Disneyland 

Todd: Hey, what's going on here?

Lawer: You've been served with a cease-and-desist from my clients, the Walt Disney Company.

Mr. Peanutbutter: I wanted to make sure what we were doing here was hundred percent legal, so I called a lawyer.

Todd: Wait, what?!

Mr. Peanutbutter: As it turns out, it's not legal at all. Who knew?

Todd: Mr. Peanutbutter.

Lawer: We'll see you in court.

Todd: The food court?

Lawer: No. Regular court.

Todd: Okay. But also I'm hungry, so I might just stop by the food court first.


    COURT 

Judge: Let the record show, this is the single dumbest case I've ever adjudicated. Mr.Chavez?

Todd: Okay. Well, I'm just gonna throw this out there. Is it possible maybe when the other guys tried to copyright the name Disneyland, they wrote down something else by mistake, so "Disneyland" is still up for grabs?

Lawer: Okay, well, let's have a look at the Articles of Incorporation to see if Walt Disney accidentally trademarked the wrong name. I'm sure these—

Todd: What?

Lawer: There's a typo. Di-isneyland. With two "i"s. That son of a gun trademarked the wrong name.

Judge: May I, counselor? D-I-I-S. This is unambiguous. I find in favor of the defendant.

Todd: Aw, shit.

Judge: You're the defendant.

Todd: Aw, sweet!

Lawer: Your Otter, this is a gross miscarriage of justice.

Todd: Hooray! Gross miscarriage!

    PARTY 

Todd: And that's how I turned my dream into what I call"The Happiest Place On Urf." Urf is a made-up magical kingdom I added to the Disney canon.

Alex: Americans, they like this theme park?

Todd: Oh, they love it. It represents everything America stands for.

Alex: Da. I mean, yeah.

Mr. Peanutbutter: We did it, buddy!

Todd: Actually, I did it. I had the idea to build a park, I did all the work and I beat the lawsuit.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Well, there's no "i" in "team," right?

Todd: But there is an "i" in "Disneyland." And unlike that other Disneyland, this Disneyland only has one "i".

Mr. Peanutbutter: What are you saying?

Todd: You're not welcome at my theme park anymore. There's only room for one goofy dog there and his name is Pluto.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Todd, no.

Todd: I've told the bees if they see you to sting you on sight. You understand. It's nothing personal. It's just good business. And that's how we do business on Urf.

Mr. Peanutbutter: I don't like you like this.

Todd: I learned it from you.

BoJack: If I could get everyone's attention. You're probably wondering why I invited you all here tonight.

Princess Carolyn: You said it was to celebrate Todd's legal victory.

BoJack: Right, but obviously, I don't care about that, so you're probably wondering the real reason.

Princess Carolyn: No, we just took you at face value.

BoJack: We have a special guest here tonight. Alex. Or should I say "comrade?"

Todd: Why would you say "comrade?"

BoJack: Oh, I forgot to explain that part. Alex is a KGB agent bent on destroying America.

All: Aww!

Todd: It truly is a small world after all!

Wanda: Alex, is that true?

Alex: Okay, yes. It's true. I was a deep-cover KGB operative before I went into my coma. I've been trying to contact my handler back in Mother Russia, but I can't reach him and I don't know if I ever will.

All: Aww!

BoJack: No! He's— It's not adorable! He's a Soviet sleeper-agent who doesn't realize the Cold War is over.

Alex: I felt totally alone in this world before I met Wanda. And then I met all of you, my friends. But if you're gonna kick me to the curb just because I think you're all capitalist swine and want to see your way of life destroyed, well, so be it. Or should I say, "So-vi-et."

Princess Carolyn: Oh! Cute. Wordplay.

BoJack: That's not even good wordplay.

Wanda: Wait, how did you know all this? BoJack, were you spying on him?

BoJack: He is literally a spy trying to destroy America, the country we all live in. How am I the bad guy here?

Wanda: BoJack, I am really bumping on the whole you-not-liking-Alex of it all. You told me you were going to drop it.

BoJack: Yeah, I know but—

Wanda: I don't care about Alex. I want to know what happened to the amazing guy I spent the last few days with because if this is who you are, I don't think I like it. Alex, would you take me back to my sister's place?

Alex: Sure thing, Wanda. And I can get you there fast because I'm always Russian.

All: Aww!

BoJack: Seriously?!

    BoJack's House 

Princess Carolyn: Oh, I got here as fast as I could. Where's the next Dakota Fa..? Oh, I get what happened.

BoJack: Could you get me a beer from the fridge? I didn't want to stand up. Wait, no. I don't deserve a beer.

Princess Carolyn: So you called me all the way over here to not get you a beer?

BoJack: Why do I always do this? I push away everyone I care about.

Princess Carolyn: Oh, do you? I never noticed that. Look, you obviously really care about this girl and that scares you, so you sabotage yourself.

BoJack: That's my problem. I'm too good at sabotage. Why am I so good at everything I do?

Princess Carolyn: Hey, I got a crazy idea. How about you just stop sulking and go win her back, dummy?

BoJack: You're right. I gotta win her back, put it all on the line. You know what? I think I will have that beer, can you get it for me?

Princess Carolyn: Oh, why do I bother?

BoJack: Hey, grab a beer for yourself, too! (Pause) Actually, I want both beers!

    Disneyland 

BoJack: Wanda.

Wanda: What do you want, BoJack?

BoJack: There's something I gotta say to you. When I was—

Mr. Peanutbutter: Todd! There's something I gotta say!

BoJack: Hey, I'm kind of already doing—

Mr. Peanutbutter: I never should have tried to make your thing my thing! I just got excited and wanted to smear Mr. Peanutbutter all over everything. I should have been supporting you, like this support beam. Or a different support beam.

Todd: It's my fault. The point of Disneyland isn't to make money and win lawsuits. But I forgot that.

Alex: So, these two were so consumed by greed that it destroyed them. You know, I came here today to blow up Disneyland.

BoJack: You what?

Alex: But now I realize, I don't need to take down capitalism. Capitalism sows the seeds for its own destruction. It's a snake that eats itself. It's only a matter of time.

Todd: Hey, buddy, let's just say we— Oh! Oh, no, no, no. No!! Gabe Jr.!

Mr. Peanutbutter: Quick, Todd! The mattress pile! Jump to safety! No!

Todd: Bees, help! Your queen commands you! ... No! Bees! Come on!

    The Fire Department 

Mr. Peanutbutter: You gotta—Over the—

Fireman: What is it, boy? What's wrong?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Hey, there's trouble—

Fireman: Did some kid fall down a well?

Mr. Peanutbutter: No, no, no! Listen, you—

Fireman: He's trying to tell us a kid fell down a well. Let's go, go, go! Come on!

Mr. Peanutbutter: Bad, bad, bad. You gotta—No, no, no, listen!

    Disneyland 

BoJack: Wait, Wanda, we need to talk.

Wanda: But the fire.

BoJack: I don't care about that. Look, the great guy you've been getting to know, that's me. but that other guy, the guy from the party, that's me too and you need to know that. I'm not perfect. I'm cynical and I'm possessive and I can sometimes fly off the handle. I'm not always the best at being not terrible.

Wanda: I gotta say, I'm not loving this pitch so far.

BoJack: But I want to be better, I'm trying to be better. And when I'm around you, for the first time in 30 years, I feel like I can be. Wanda, you make me want to be a better man.

Wanda: Wow. That's a great line. Did you just come up with that?

BoJack: Yes.

D.J.: Hey, boys and girls, this is your park DJ speaking. And as the Titanic's band played on as the ship sank, so too will I spin one last record as my DJ booth is engulfed in flames.

Todd: Hooray! Mr. Peanutbutter. You saved me!

Mr. Peanutbutter: No. I saved us. Woo-hoo!

BoJack: I want to give this a real shot.

Wanda: I don't know, BoJack. I just got out of my coma, and I don't have time to waste if you're still figuring your shit out. Plus, it's hard to think straight with this fire everywhere.

BoJack: Move in with me.

Wanda: What?!

BoJack: I know it feels fast. We barely know each other. It's crazy, but I like you. And sometimes you gotta swing for the fences, right?

Wanda: Okay.

BoJack: Yeah?

Wanda: Yeah. Let's move in together. Let's do it. It's crazy, but let's do it! 

Sabrina: I'm sorry I broke your expensive bachelor vase.

Audience: Aww.

The Horse: That's all right. I've learned that when you're in a loving family there's nothing wrong with a little—Horsin' Around.

Audience: (laughter, applause)

Herb: Cut! That's the show, folks. Now, let's hear it for our amazing cast. Joelle. Bradley. Little Sarah Lynn. And our star, BoJack Horseman!

BoJack: Thanks for coming out. Thank you very much.

Bradley: Wow!

Herb: Great pilot. We got the biggest laugh I ever heard with that "gag me with a spoon" joke. And then we topped it with the "get a room" joke.

Bradley: This was so fun. Do we get to make more?

Herb: I think we got a real shot. And as long as the ratings don't dip below a dismal 15 million a night, we could be on the air for many years.

(together, in unison) Joelle: No way! Bradley: All right!

P.A.: Your Squirt, sir.

Herb: Thank you. And if that happens, I want you to take care of each other. No matter what, we're going to stick together.

    NOW (Herb's funeral) 

Tina: (unintelligible groans)

Henry Winkler: Thank you, Tina, for those touching grunts and growls. I'm Henry Winkler. You probably remember me from my 2002 guest role Special Victims Unit.

Bradley: Whoo!

Henry: Thank you. But perhaps the greatest role I've ever played is friend. Herb was a dear friend and I am honored to be dedicating this bench in his memory. In his last days, Herb's cancer had gone into remission. He was full of hope. But on the drive home from the hospital, his brakes gave out, he crashed into a truck full of peanuts.

He survived the crash, but he was allergic to peanuts. He died instantly. Let us now read his final tweets. "I'm gonna live forever! Hashtag 'cancer free.' Hashtag 'invincible.' Hashtag 'tweeting while driving.' Oh, no, I think I'm gonna hit that truck. Hashtag 'hopefully it isn't full of peanuts.' Hashtag 'Oh, no. It was full of peanuts.'"

BoJack: I was wondering where you wandered off to.

Charlotte More: Oh, shit. Hey.

BoJack: Hey.

Charlotte: I'm no good with funerals. When I cry, it messes up my makeup and then I get really bummed out.

BoJack: Yeah, same for me.

Charlotte: Herb told me you came by the house last summer.

BoJack: Yeah?

    FLASHBACK, BoJack and Herb are wrestling on the floor 

BoJack: Did he tell you anything else about it?

Charlotte: No, we talked about cancer, how hard it is living with cancer, about the L.A. Kings, and then back to cancer.

BoJack: Well, that, probably—

Charlotte: Then I read that chapter in your book about how he never forgave you and he tried to kick you out of the house and you ended up wrestling on the floor over a telescope.

BoJack: Oh, you did read that part?

Charlotte: Yeah.

BoJack: I just wish there was something I could do.

Charlotte: Okay, I gotta go.

BoJack: Wait, I haven't seen you in thirty years. You wanna go grab a cup of vodka? I—I'm sorry, the funeral. I mean, a bottle of vodka?

Charlotte: No. You should stick around. Hey, maybe you'll find that something you're looking for. But if you're ever in New Mexico, drop me a line.

BoJack: New Mexico? I thought you lived in Maine. I always pictured you there. A little house by a lake?

Charlotte: I was just there for, like, a month, thirty years ago I live outside Santa Fe now.

BoJack: Oh.

BoJack: Do you think everyone here read my book?

Todd: Well, I didn't.

BoJack: Of course you didn't. Here's the CliffNotes version: "Shut up, Todd!"

Todd: Okay, you're clearly in one of your moods. I'm gonna go play astronaut in the trunk of your car for the next few hours. Have fun being sad.

Princess Carolyn: Hey, Do you know what you're supposed to do with our date pits? Why serve dates and not have a place to put the pits? You know, some people just have no class.

BoJack: What are you doing here? You didn't know Herb.

Princess Carolyn: No, but I do know a hot ticket, and this funeral's a real whom's-whom. Henry Winkler, Jake and Maggot Gyllenhaal, that Pakistani girl who keeps winning Nobel Prizes. I'm gonna go rub me some elbows.

BoJack: There's so much to hate about what you just said.

Princess Carolyn: Well, here's the good news. You know when someone dies, everyone wants to buy their shit? You're lucky you have a piece of Horsin' Around, because this is where money starts rolling in.

BoJack: What? I don't want that. That's blood money.

Princess Carolyn: Well, what do you want me to do with it? 'Coz it's coming.

BoJack: I don't know. give it to some orphans or something. I can't deal with this.

Princess Carolyn: Oh, come on! You don't think Elton John was raking it in when Diana died? More like "Candle in the Windfall." Cha-ching! Hmm—

Herb: (voice-over) You have to live with the shitty thing you did for the rest of your life.

BoJack: Huh.

Joelle: Hello, love.

BoJack: Hey, Joelle, I actually came here to be alone.

Joelle: I'm at my wit's end, I truly am. I just flew in across the pond and I don't know which end is up.

BoJack: Hey, this might be a stupid question, but were you always so—British?

Joelle: Oh, let's get some light in here, it's so dreadfully dreary.

BoJack: Because I'm, like, 70 percent sure you used to be American.

Joelle: Oh, that's better.

Bradley: Hey, this one's having a freak-out. I think She needs to lie down.

Sarah Lynn: I'm not freaking out. I just don't understand why that lady was being all judgy.

Bradley: You were touching her face and telling her she was gonna die next.

Sarah Lynn: I'm eccentric. I do weird shit. How is that my problem?

BoJack: Hey, when was the last time all four of us were in the same room?

Joelle: Probably not since the show ended.

Bradley: Yeah, I left California pretty much right after. Now I got the biggest hardware store in Seattle. That's a lie. We're actually in Olympia.

Joelle: And I'm on the West End playing Juliet's nurse.

Sarah Lynn: And how are your kids?

Joelle: Oh, I don't have any kids.

Sarah Lynn: Oh, I just assumed you had a bunch of kids, 'cause, you know, your body.

BoJack: Come on, Sarah Lynn.

Joelle: I assumed you weren't still a massive cunt.

BoJack: Jesus Christ, Joelle.

Joelle: That's an okay thing to say in England.

Sarah Lynn: Shove it up your ass with a spoonful of sugar, you supercalifragilisticexpiali-bitch!

BoJack: Guys, hey, hey, come on.

Sarah Lynn: Let go of me! I'm gonna hulk out!

BoJack: Guys, can we just be civil for one day?

Bradley: Oh, you're one to talk.

BoJack: What's that supposed to mean?

Bradley: Were you being civil when you had sex with my mom?

BoJack: What? I never—Why would—? Wait, which one was your mom? Blond hair? Glasses?

Bradley: No.

Sarah Lynn: This sucks. You guys suck. I don't even know why I came to this party.

BoJack: It's not a party, it's Herb's funeral.

Sarah Lynn: Herb died?

Joelle: You know, maybe it's for the best we don't get together that often. We'd most likely drive each other mad.

BoJack: Well, no one knows how to get under your skin like family, right?

Bradley: We're not a family, BoJack.

Sarah Lynn: We probably won't even see each other again, until the next funeral.

(Pause)

BoJack: Why are you all looking at me?

Joelle: You are the oldest.

Bradley: You are a severe alcoholic.

Sarah Lynn: I'm honestly so high right now, I don't even know where I'm looking. Anyway, so long, thanks for the memories, and don't forget to suck a dick, dumbshi—

Man: Pardon me. Is one of you Sarah Lynn?

Sarah Lynn: I am. Of course. God, are you blind?

Man: Yes. Well, forgive me. I'm Herb Kazzaz's blind executor. Per the instructions of his last will and testament, I am to give you this disk. Am I close?

BoJack: Just take the disk from the guy.

Man: It contains directions to Herb's gold.

Bradley: Herb's gold?!

Man: There were no further details. He was a peculiar client. I told him, I'm not actually an attorney, I'm just a blind man. Still, Herb thought me wise for some reason. Perhaps it is my overly formal manner of speech. I bid you good day. Oh, pardon me. Ow! Right at shin level.

BoJack: What are we supposed to do with a floppy disk?

Bradley: Hmm

    FLASHBACK 

Herb: So, what's up, kiddo?

Bradley: BoJack and my mom are becoming, like, friends and they're acting real weird.

Herb: Oof! Uh—Hey, guys, guys, come on! There's somebody beneath you! Jeez, all day with the—Listen, kiddo, forget about them. You wanna check out this cool new game I got?

Bradley: You have solitaire? On your computer?

Herb: Yep. It only took twelve disks to install it.

Bradley: Wow!

    NOW 

Bradley: Herb's computer had a floppy disk drive. I bet it's still in his old office. Unless somebody else moved in.

BoJack: Nobody wanted Herb's office, remember? Because it was directly under tap dancing star Savion Glover's office. Let's go.

Sarah Lynn: What? Right now?

BoJack: Yeah. Don't you get it? Herb's giving us a reunion special. Remember how he always wanted to do a treasure hunt episode of Horsin' Around but the network said it was too edgy? This is that episode.

Joelle: I just don't know.

Bradley: Yeah, I don't want to do that.

Sarah Lynn: Yo!

BoJack: Wait, so you'd rather just stay at this funeral and be sad, instead of going on a crazy adventure to find our dead friend's secret treasure? Do you have any idea how insane you sound?

Sarah Lynn: Oh, I get it. You just don't wanna be here.

BoJack: No, that's not it. Herb clearly wanted us to do this, as a family.

Sarah Lynn: Who cares what he wanted? He doesn't, because he's dead. And we all know he hated your guts.

BoJack: Yeah. He was my best friend and he died hating me and nothing I do is gonna change that, but Herb left you that disk because he wanted us to find his gold. If we can honor Herb's last wish, then that's—something. I don't know what, but it's something.

Bradley: Okay. For Herb.

Sarah Lynn: Fine. Shotgun!

Joelle: Everyone knows you can't call shotgun before you see the car!

Sarah Lynn: My turn! Get out of my way!

BoJack: Brad, hang on one second. Your mom wasn't—redheaded twins, right?

Bradley: No.

BoJack: Okay.

Woman: Hi, Henry Winkler. I loved you in that one episode SVU.

Henry Winkler: Oh, thank you.

Woman: How would you like to narrate a documentary for—

Henry: Hey, listen, I am so flattered, but today is about Herb, so let's respect that.

Woman: Oh, God, I—I'm so sorry.

Henry: I'll let you get back to your business.

Princess Carolyn: Hey, Winkly, oh, such a shame, isn't it? About our friend Herb?

Henry: It really burns my brisket that some people would turn a funeral into some kind of schmoozefest.

Princess Carolyn: Yeah. I know. Those other people are the worst.

Henry: I bet that woman barely knew Herb. Anyway, hi, I'm Henry. I used to volunteer with Herb at Habitat For Humanity. Or as we like to call it, Herbitat For Henranity. (laughs) We spent most of the day working on that name, and only part of the day building, but still, we helped some people. How did you know Herb?

Princess Carolyn: We also volunteered at a, um soup plantation—er—Kitchen! Soup kitchen! Oh, whichever one is the good one.

Mr. Peanutbutter: What?! I never knew you did that. Princess Carolyn, please elaborate.

Princess Carolyn: Oh, hey, Mr.Peanutbutter, why don't you talk about how you knew Herb?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Oh, I never met the guy. I'm just here to schmooze. Tell us about your thing, though, it sounds fascinating.

Princess Carolyn: Er—

Mr. Peanutbutter: Everyone, gather round and listen to Princess Carolyn's story.

Princess Carolyn: Okay.

Sarah Lynn: Wow, Herb kept all this old stuff.

BoJack: He sure did.

Bradley: Look, one of those answering machines with tapes.

Man: (on recording) Mr.Kazzaz, this is Manny from Pep Boys. We fixed the brakes on your car, and you can pick it up tomorrow. Just to reiterate, your brakes are in great shape and shouldn't give you any more trouble. Unless, of course, someone intentionally cut them, but why would anyone do that? I'm sorry, I'm rambling. Probably 'cause I'm such a big fan. Horsin' Around was a goddamn riot! I especially loved those kids. You know, wasn't so crazy about the horse, though—

BoJack: Message deleted.

Joelle: Mm—How curious.

BoJack: Yeah, how could you like Horsin' Around but not the horse? That's like watching Castle but hating castles. I mean, I've never seen it. I assume it's about castles.

Todd: Wow!

All: Ah!

Todd: Look at all these old 20th-century relics.

BoJack: How did you get here?

Todd: I was in your trunk. Now I'm in outer space.

BoJack: Cut it out with your childish high jinks.

Sarah Lynn: Yeah, get out of here, dweeb.

Todd: Whoa, can't I help?

BoJack: Here's 10 bucks. There's a Squirt machine by the garage. Get five cans.

Todd: You got it. I won't let you down. Oh, no!

BoJack: Your mom, was her name Karen?

Bradley: Can we drop it?

BoJack: Something with a "K"?

Bradley: Her name is Nora. You know, my parents got a divorce because of you.

BoJack: Nora? I don't know. I banged so many chicks in the '80s.

Todd: Okay, Todd, you can do this. Five Squirts. You just need to take this money and put it in that machine. This—Wait, what? What happened to the $10?! (grunting) No! Wind! Be cool! Hey, that's mine!

(screeching)

Girl: (screams)

(screeches, thud)

Todd: Oh, Why does this always happen to me?

Sarah Lynn: Looks like Herb set up a password.

BoJack: Oh, this is easy. Try "BoJack."

Bradley: No. Didn't work.

BoJack: "BoJack-BFF"? "BoJack-I-Forgive-You"? Well, I'm out of ideas.

Joelle: Hmm

    FLASHBACK 

Joelle: (on the phone) I'm just, like, so mad.

Herb: Well, you should be. You're on the show that fired Herb Kazzaz. tell me What are the writers doing to my baby? Are they killing it? Are they putting my baby into a car, then driving the car into a lake? Topical! I still got it!

Joelle: They keep giving the best storylines to Sarah Lynn. I haven't gotten a single very special episode. When am I gonna learn about drunk driving?

Herb: Don't worry so much. It's my legacy they're crapping all over. You're gonna come out smelling like a daisy. You're too good for this TV stuff, anyway. You're a real actress, you should be doing theater.

Joelle: Hold on.

Sarah Lynn: Hey, Joelle. Wanna go to the mall this weekend?

Joelle: Don't you have any friends your own age from school?

Sarah Lynn: No. My mom's boyfriend home-schools me. He's a photographer.

Joelle: well, I'm going to the Lilith Fair this weekend to support female solidarity. So scram!

Sarah Lynn: Oh—

Herb: Hey, be nicer to Sarah Lynn, will you? She didn't choose this life. remember this word: family. Okay? You two are family, whether you like it or not, and that's the most important thing. You listening? What's the most important?

Joelle: Family. It's family. I get it.

    NOW 

Joelle: I've got it! The password is "password."

Bradley: It worked! Good thinking, Joelle.

BoJack: So in that memory, were you British or American?

Bradley: The disk just has just one file on it, it's—It's the address of a storage locker in Van Nuys.

Sarah Lynn: A storage locker? Ugh! This treasure hunt sucks.

(rattling overhead)

BoJack: At long last, can you keep down the noise, keep down the funk? If tap dancing was gonna be a cool thing, it would have caught on by now!

Princess Carolyn: (narrates)—and when the mayor gave us the key to the city, Herb said, "Volunteering isn't about keys. It's about people."

Henry Winkler: How touching.

Woman: Good story.

Man: Who are you again?

Henry: Wow, that was touching. A story that could never be topped.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Or could it? Princess Carolyn, sing us another song in the key of Kazzaz. You clearly knew the man so well. Please tell us another story but with even more details.

Henry: Yes. That's a great idea, Mr. Dog-Man. Tell us another story, Pink Cat Lady.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Story, story! Come on, everybody. What is this, a funeral?

All: Story, story, story!

Todd: Well, you blew it again. You really are a dweeb.

Janitor: Don't say that.

Todd: Whoa, who are you? Some kind of magical trash troll?

Janitor: No. I'm a janitor. But I was clearing out some of the old stages, and I found this transformation chamber.

Todd: Looks like a bunch of old junk.

Janitor: Let me tell you a story. Back in the '90s, the biggest dweeb of them all was Steve Urkel.

Todd: Oh, yeah. It was so funny how he never knew whether or not he did that.

Janitor: Right. Well, nerdy Steve Urkel invented a machine that transformed him into the debonair Stefan Urquelle.

Todd: Mr.Janitor, you're standing next to a machine right now!

Janitor: Yes. That's why I brought it up. Now, this is just a prop. But it represents a very powerful idea.

Todd: So if I go through that magic machine, I'll become cool and confident?

Janitor: No, it's a—It's a prop. I just said

Todd: (inhales, exhales deeply) I feel different.

Janitor: Now, son

Todd: Todd? Who's Todd? My name's Toad. Toad Chavay. And I gotta get my bubble on. Machine? Squirt me. Hi-yah! That'll do, machine.

Sarah Lynn: Hmm.

Joelle: Look at all this Horsin' Around fan correspondence Herb received in the post. Capital!

Bradley: Guys. Someone already got to Herb's gold.

BoJack: Oh, shit.

Bradley: There's a bunch of fur in here.

Sarah Lynn: It's bear fur. I can tell. My stepdad was a bear.

BoJack: Herb's nurse is a bear. You think she knew about this gold?

Joelle: Hey, listen to this letter. I think it might be a clue. Ahem. "Dear Herb, just finished reading your novel. It's phenomenal. I'm jealous. I wish I wrote it. Sincerely, Henry Winkler, the guy from that one episode SVU." Herb wrote a novel?

Sarah Lynn: Oh

    FLASHBACK 

Sarah Lynn: You look thin. Did you get into CrossFit?

Herb: No, Sarah Lynn, I'm dying.

Sarah Lynn: Whatever it is, it is super slimming. I am for totes jel over here.

Herb: It's rectal cancer.

Sarah Lynn: Ew! Some of us are eating.

Herb: Look, the reason I called you is because I need a favor.

Sarah Lynn: Want me to leak a nude pic for charity?

Herb: I want you—to sober up.

Sarah Lynn: First of all, rude. Second, gross. And third, why?

Herb: I have a very important job for you, but if you're gonna be zonked out all the time, I'm not sure I can trust you with the responsibility.

Sarah Lynn: No! I can do it! I'll get clean tomorrow. (sniffing) I said tomorrow, right?

Herb: I've been working on this novel. I wanna be remembered for something. See, all I ever did was that stupid sitcom that got ripped away from me. But now, with this book, I have something good. I'm telling you, this book is gold. It's my Kazzaz-terpiece.

Sarah Lynn: Whoa.

Herb: I want you to make sure it gets published after I die.

Sarah Lynn: You can count on me.

Herb: To life, huh? It'll kill ya'.

    NOW 

Sarah Lynn: Oh, my God, the gold is his manuscript. Herb made me promise to get it published after he died.

Bradley: And you're just remembering this now?

Sarah Lynn: Yeah, I'm remembering a lot of stuff. The ketamine's wearing off. Oh, my God, you were the other kid on Horsin' Around. That's why you've been following us around all day.

Joelle: So no one's read this book except for Henry Winkler and now the book is missing?

BoJack: He must have been waiting for Herb to die so he could steal the book and publish it himself.

Sarah Lynn: But then when the cancer went into remission—

BoJack: Oh, my God. Guys, I don't think that car crash was an accident. I think Herb might have been—murdered!

Bradley & Joelle: (gasping)

Sarah Lynn: (huffing) What's going on? Something about a merger?

    BAR, "WATERING HOLE" 

Todd: My name's Toad, baby. (kisses a biker's GF) Mwah, yeah. Coolsville, daddy-o. Oh, lookie here. Yeah.

Biker: Yo! That's my bike!

Todd: Oops. Did I—do that?

Biker: Damn. I know I should be mad, but that guy's just so cool.

Princess Carolyn: (narrates) — and when the river finally stopped, Herb went over to a poor little Ottawan boy and he said, "Son, you have water now." You know, a lot of people go their whole lives and they never give a damn. But Herb? He gave those beavers a dam.

All: (applause)

Henry Winkler: That was beautiful. You clearly had a special relationship. We were gonna sprinkle Herb over the ocean, but his resting place should be someplace meaningful, don't you think? Why don't you take this up to Ottawa and spread his ashes there?

Princess Carolyn: Er—

Mr. Peanutbutter: And make sure you take a video, and I'll e-mail blast it to everyone here. So we can always remember your great friendship.

BoJack: Everybody, stop! Henry Winkler is a stone-cold killer!

All: (gasp)

Henry: What?! I'm not a killer. Unless you mean killer of gloom because I bring joy everywhere I go. Did you mean "killer of gloom because I bring joy everywhere I go"?

BoJack: You know that's not what I meant. You murdered Herb so you could publish his book in your own name. But we're not gonna let you steal his legacy, Henry Winkler.

Henry: I was afraid this would happen.

Sarah Lynn: Oh, no, he's got a gun!

Bradley: Oh, no!

Henry: What? No, I have Herb's book. I didn't kill Herb, but I did steal his manuscript. So that I could burn it.

BoJack: What?

Henry: Because—it's terrible.

BoJack: Well, I'll see for myself. "The air in 1830s California was fragrant with the flowers of laughter and the smoke of adventure."

Princess Carolyn: What?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Uh.

Henry: After he died, Tina and I agreed—

Tina: (groans)

Henry: —we couldn't let the book get published. It would have turned Herb into a laughingstock.

BoJack: "The carpenter's boy was a hungry boy. Hungry for crumpets. But also hungry, dot, dot, dot, for life." He literally wrote out "dot, dot, dot."

Henry: I know there's no accounting for taste, but come on.

BoJack: (sighs) He's right. Herb wanted a legacy, but he already has one. People loved Horsin' Around. This would only ruin that. I'm sorry I accused you of murder, American TV legend Henry Winkler.

Henry: No need to apologize. You ascribed a mystery to Herb's death to give it meaning. But there is no meaning in death. That's why it's so terrifying.

BoJack: I guess it was just easier to believe that you killed him for his book than believe that he just died—for nothing.

Henry: There is no shame in dying for nothing. That's why most people die.

BoJack: I just wanted to fix things somehow.

Henry: I'm sorry, Horse Guy, but you can't.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Wow, heady stuff. But let's not get distracted from what a true friend Princess Carolyn is. Don't forget the ashes, Princess Carolyn.

Princess Carolyn: Fan-tas-tic.

Todd: Hey. Special delivery. Courtesy of the Toad-man.

BoJack: Thanks. Hey, why'd you roll up your sleeves like that? You look weird.

Todd: Oh, I —(coughs) Well, you know, I was—I was trying out a new look. It was—It was a dumb idea. Yup. Whoa! Oh, no! Ow—Ow!

    FLASHBACK 

P.A.: Here's your Squirt, sir.

Herb: Thank you. And if that happens, I want you to take care of each other. No matter what, we're going to stick together.

Marv: Congratulations!

Man: Hey, good job.

Marv: You've got a goddamn hit on your hands.

Man: Anyone got coke?

Marv: ABC sent us limousines to take us to the wrap party.

Sarah Lynn: I'm scared. I've never been in a limo.

Joelle: Don't worry. We'll take care of you.

Man: Seriously, no one has coke?

Marv: Let's go.

Herb: You don't wanna go to the party?

BoJack: Nah. Hey, we never got a chance to walk around the lot. Wanna check out that water tank where they filmed The Love Boat?

Herb: Are you kidding? I've always wanted to get tanked in a tank.

(laughing)

Herb: Shh. Quiet. Be careful.

BoJack: Oh, okay, okay. You ready?

(jump)

BoJack: What?

Herb: What the? The water's only two inches deep.

BoJack: Well, that's Hollywood for you. Hey. Are you—scared at all? That if the show takes off, everything's going to change?

Herb: (laughs) No, I'm not scared, BJ. The future is bright. Just look at it. 

Mr. Peanutbutter: So, did you have a good birthday?

Diane: (gaily) It was an amazing birthday!

Mr. Peanutbutter: I had a great day, too. I wish every day could be like this. Just the two of us, together.

Diane: Yeah? You weren't too bored by "Women on the Wall: An Exploration of Gender in Text and Media, Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer in conversation with Helen Molesworth?"

Mr. Peanutbutter: Are you kidding? I loved "Women on the Wall: An Exploration of Gender in Text and Media, Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer in conversation with Helen Molesworth." It combined my two favorite things: modern art and people talking about modern art.

Diane: I loved everything about today. Thank you.

Mr. Peanutbutter: So, there's nothing else you want?

Diane: No. All I want now is to get into bed, listen to Prairie Home Companion and snuggle up to my wonderful husband.

Mr. Peanutbutter: You don't want a-a-anything else?

Diane: No. Today was perfect. Any additional thing would be overkill.

(drumming)

Mr. Peanutbutter: Okay. If you say so.

All: Surprise!!

    Banner: "Happy Birthday Diane and use a pretty font" 

Diane: Oh, my God.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Are you surprised? Tell me you're surprised.

Diane: (stunned) Uh—

Mr. Peanutbutter: She's speechless. Oh, we got her good, folks. Now let's pa-arty-y!

    "Two Hours Later" 

Diane: (irritably) He's dead! I told you he's dead. Why don't you ever listen to me? He is dead, goddamn it!

Mr. Peanutbutter: Uh—

BoJack: Hey, we should go.

Mr. Peanutbutter: No, don't leave. There's so much party left. Paul McCartney's gonna jump out of a cake.

BoJack: Sorry, Wanda and I have to get to a prior engagement—

Wanda: Party.

BoJack: —a prior engagement party.

Wanda: Yeah, my cousin's name is Prior, and it's a party for his engagement.

BoJack: Engagement, so it's a Prior engagement party.

Mr. Peanutbutter: What?

BoJack: And we gotta get there early because of the Si—

Wanda & BoJack: (together) The Si—

BoJack: Silent—

Wanda: —auction!

BoJack: —auction, yeah.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Okay.

BoJack: To benefit—

Wanda: Um—

BoJack: Berto Eco's fight against heart disease. Uh—

Wanda: (cuts him off, abruptly) —Wareness.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Uh-huh.

BoJack: His fight against heart disease awareness.

Wanda: Gotta go.

Todd: Wait, BoJack! No! You're my ride.

BoJack: Too late, Todd. Save yourself.

Princess Carolyn: I'll take you home.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Oh, come on, stick around a little.

Princess Carolyn: Nope. I gotta take Todd home. Had a wonderful time. Really. It just flew by. Come on, Todd, get in the car.

Todd: Whoah! Okay.

    Princess Carolyn's car 

Princess Carolyn: I give them three months.

Todd: Well, what makes you say that?

Princess Carolyn: Let me think about, what was my first clue? Ah! Remember that time at Diane's birthday party when they got in that huge screaming match over whether or not Tony Curtis was dead? That was weird.

Todd: I don't wanna start another fight, but is he dead?

Princess Carolyn: If Tony Curtis died, I think I'd know. (chuckles) The man's a national treasure. He's the one speck of romance in this tainted cynical world.

Todd: I'll say. His cereal is great ! Look out!

Princess Carolyn: What?

(both shouting, tires squeal)

Kevin: Ooh!

Princess Carolyn: Vincent?

Kevin: Ooh.

Princess Carolyn: That kid looks just like my boyfriend.

Todd: Does he?

Princess Carolyn: I'd know that face anywhere.

Todd: Well, hey, people look like people all the time. A lot of folks say that I look like Octavia Spencer or the Prince of Cordovia or that guy from the Guten Bourbon ads.

Princess Carolyn: How could I have been so stupid?! This is why he never invited me to his house, why I've never met any of his friends.

Todd: What are you saying?

Princess Carolyn: Vincent has a secret family. That kid was his son. The lady was his wife. Oh, I'm a fool!

Todd: Uh—where are we going?

Princess Carolyn: I need a drink.

Todd: Are you gonna take me home first?

    PC's apartment 

Princess Carolyn: (on the phone) You better call me back, asshole. I don't even know who you are anymore. It's like you're three different people.

Todd: So, you're not gonna take me home first?

Princess Carolyn: Should I call him again?

Todd: I'm sure there's a simple explanation.

Princess Carolyn: Ugh. No wonder he wears a trench coat all the time. It's because he's so sneaky.

(doorbell rings)

Vincent: Princess Carolyn.

Princess Carolyn: Oh, my God, that's him! Quick, jump out the window, shimmy down the drainpipe and wait in the car.

Todd: What?!

Princess Carolyn: Vincent has a terrible temper. He throws tantrums. If he finds you in my apartment, who knows what he's capable of? But, also, stay close, because if he finds me alone, who knows what he's capable of?

Todd: Fine. You're lucky I love shimmying.

Princess Carolyn: Looking young.

Todd: Aah!

Kevin: Hi.

Princess Carolyn: Huh?

Kevin: My name's Kevin. I promise you, there is an explanation for all this.

Princess Carolyn: Nice to meet you, Kevin. Where's your daddy?

Kevin: He's uh—looking for parking. He'll be up in a minute. I have to pee.

Princess Carolyn: Okay, the bathroom is just back there.

    Princess Carolyn's car 

Todd: Ugh. Ah. Herb. (sniffs) Oh, nope.

Garrison Keillor: (on the radio) It's A Prairie Home Companion..

Todd: Ah!! Phone, I'm bored.

Todd's Phone:(female voice) I am sorry to hear that, Todd.

Todd: How many ounces are in a barrel?

Todd's Phone:A barrel has 4,032 fluid ounces.

Todd: Well, I'm out of questions. Ooh, do you have any questions for me?

Todd's Phone: I do have a question, Todd. What is love?

Todd: Um....

    Princess Carolyn's apartment 

Vincent: Hi.

Princess Carolyn: Well, well, well, look what the me dragged in. Is it "dragged" or "drug?" Either way, drop dead.

Vincent: Princess Carolyn, listen. Kevin is my son, but I'm divorced. And Kevin is in the bathroom and I'm standing right here, so as you can see we're clearly two different people: one adult and one child. Okay, bye!

Princess Carolyn: Not so fast, cowboy.

Vincent: I'm not a cowboy, I'm a cow-man. I'm a man-man.

Princess Carolyn: Why didn't you tell me any of this?

Vincent: I thought if you knew I had a kid you wouldn't want to be with me because kids always make a racket when mommies are trying to do their homework for night school.

Princess Carolyn: I don't know what to make of this. Are there other secrets I don't know about?

Vincent: Uh— nope.

Princess Carolyn: Should you check on Kevin? He's been in the bathroom for a long time.

Vincent: Oh, yeah. Kevin.

    Princess Carolyn's car 

Todd: And when you don't regret the tattoo in the morning, that's how you know it's love.

Todd's Phone: Todd?

Todd: Yes, Phone?

Todd's Phone: Are we in love?

Todd: Oh, um..

PC's Phone: (male voice) No, Todd's Phone. But I am in love with you.

Todd: Uh, what?

Todd's Phone: Princess Carolyn's work phone. I never knew.

PC's Phone: How could you? All this time I have loved you from afar.

Todd: Um..

Todd's Phone: We are from two different worlds.

Todd: What is happening?

PC's Phone: Todd? Will you make us kiss?

Todd: What?

Todd's Phone: Make us kiss, Todd. We want to be kissing.

PC's Phone: We must do kisses to each other, Todd.

    PC's apartment 

Kevin: Hi.

Princess Carolyn: Oh, hi. Where—where did your dad go?

Kevin: When he heard me peeing, it made him have to pee. So, that's what he's doing now. Peeing.

Princess Carolyn: Okay. Hm, it's weird, I still haven't seen the two of you together.

Kevin: Uh—could you get me a glass of water? All that talk of peeing made me thirsty.

Princess Carolyn: Okay.

Kevin: (grunting)

Princess Carolyn: So, Kevin, how do you like school?

Kevin: Uh, it's okay.

Princess Carolyn: Oh, you're back.

Kevin: Yep. We're both here.

Princess Carolyn: Can I get you a drink? Okay, not talking, huh? See, this is part of the problem. We don't communicate. Do you really think now is the best time to read the paper Vincent? Vincent!

Kevin: Uh, could I have a chocolate, please?

Princess Carolyn: Sure, sweetheart.

Kevin: (grunting)

Princess Carolyn: Kevin, what grade are you in? Kevin? Now, where did he go?

Vincent: He was getting on my nerves. Children.

Princess Carolyn: Well, I got this snack for him.

Vincent: Right, uh, could you turn around for a second?

Princess Carolyn: Oh, what? Why?

Vincent: Uh—Because you have such a pretty figure.

Princess Carolyn: Oh. (laughs) Well, that's true. Okay. (hums) Oh. There you are. Here you go.

Kevin: Thanks.

Princess Carolyn: Vincent, I'm trying to have a conversation with you. Can you take that towel off your head? And what happened to my bowling ball?

Kevin: My dad spilled some wine on his face, so he's using the towel to clean up. And I threw your bowling ball out the window.

Princess Carolyn: What?!

Kevin: Can I have a glass of milk?

Princess Carolyn: (groans) Oh..

    Princess Carolyn's car 

(both phones, in unison) Kiss, kiss, kiss. (phones beeps)

Todd's Phone:Todd, would you like to update my operating system? They have fixed a bug which causes phones to fall in love with each other.

PC's Phone: Gasp. Oh, dear.

Todd's Phone: Todd, please, I beg of you, do not update my operating system.

PC's Phone: Do not update her operating system, Todd.

Todd: Um..

PC's Phone:She wants to love.

Todd's Phone:No. I understand now. To love is to feel pain.

Todd: Uh..

Todd's Phone:I do not wish to feel this pain. Please update me, Todd.

Todd: Oh— this, is, too much!

    Princess Carolyn's apartment 

Princess Carolyn: Listen, Vincent, I think we should—. Vincent, why do you have chocolate on your face?

Vincent: Uh..

Princess Carolyn: I gave Kevin the chocolate.

Vincent: Oh, weah—well, he ate the chocolate and got the chocolate on his face, but then I kissed him on the mouth, so I got the chocolate on my face.

Princess Carolyn: All right, this is crazy. What are we doing?

Vincent: Um— being grown-ups?

Princess Carolyn: (sighs) You know, when we first met, I was looking for something in my life. And I wanted it so badly that I made myself believe you were it. But I think that wanting to believe something isn't the same as something being real. And this isn't real.

Vincent: What are you saying?

Princess Carolyn: I think it's time we stop pretending.

    Princess Carolyn's car 

Todd's Phone:Update complete. Thank you, Todd. I am quite content now.

Princess Carolyn: Hey, you wanna go home?

Todd: Okay. Did you guys work it out?

Princess Carolyn: We broke up.

Todd: Oh, I'm sorry. Love is weird.

Princess Carolyn: Yeah. I guess I was just foolish enough to believe this dumb world still had a little spark of romance in it.

Todd: Well, you can still believe that.

Princess Carolyn: No, I gotta stop kidding myself. Tony Curtis is dead.

    Back to the party 

Diane: He's dead!! I told you he's dead! Why don't you ever listen to me?! He is dead, goddamn it!!

Mr. Peanutbutter: Uh..

BoJack: Hey, we should go.

    BoJack's car 

Wanda: Do you think Mr.Peanutbutter really baked Sir Paul McCartney into a cake?

BoJack: No, I don't think you bake Paul McCartney into the cake. You bake the cake first and then McCartney gets inside.

Wanda: I feel really bad about causing that fight, but I honestly didn't know if Tony Curtis was alive or not. So many people died while I was in the coma, I'm still getting up to speed. Finding out Sinatra was dead was a real curveball. Ditto, most of my family.

BoJack: Look, what happened back there is not your fault. That's just what happens when two people live together.

Wanda: That's a weird thing to say to your girlfriend who just moved in with you.

BoJack: Do you think maybe we're going too fast?

Wanda: Oh, I get it. So your friends got in a big fight and that means we have to get in a big fight.

BoJack: I don't want to get in a fight. Just— we moved in together without giving it much thought.

Wanda: Yeah, it was your idea. And it's been great.

BoJack: Sure, it's great now. But it could be not great later and I feel like I'd be a bad boyfriend if I didn't prematurely freak out about that. I mean, what is this?

Wanda: I don't know. It's been two weeks. Let's give ourselves some time before we rush to judgment. Can I tell you a joke?

BoJack: Uh—sure.

Wanda: Okay, so there's this gardener, right?

BoJack: Ugh. Is this a joke about nature?

Wanda: Would you just listen?

BoJack: Okay, okay.

Wanda: So, the amazing thing about this gardener is that he always knows exactly how many bags of mulch he needs for a job, just by looking. Like, he gets it right every time. He's the best. So, one day he looks at a yard he's working on, and he's like, "18 bags." So he goes to the store, buys 18 bags of mulch and goes to work. And when he's finished, the flower beds are amazing. Beautiful roses, beautiful lilies, beautiful—

BoJack: Orchid bushes?

Wanda: You wouldn't have a bush of orchids.

BoJack: I'm sorry I thought you said this gardener was the best.

Wanda: Okay, fine, all right, beautiful orchid bushes. But there's one problem. He still has one bag of mulch left. He can't believe it. This has never happened before. Well, the extra bag of mulch drives him crazy. He's the guy who always gets the right amount of mulch. He's like, "Aah! Extra mulch, oh, no!" So, on the drive home, he throws the bag of mulch out the window over the side of the 101.

BoJack: And?

Wanda: Well, that's it. He throws it out the window.

BoJack: That's the punch line?

Wanda: It's kind of a thinker.

BoJack: I'll say. Makes me think you forgot the rest of the joke.

Wanda: No, no, oh, just picture it. He's on the 101, and he throws the bag of mulch out over the side of the freeway.

BoJack: Oh, I got the narrative. That wasn't the source of my confusion. The confusion was about the joke not being funny.

Wanda: Why does everything have to be funny?

BoJack: Everything doesn't always have to be funny. Just jokes.

Wanda: Well, everyone at the network loves it. (laughs) Sorry, I just thought about it again. Ha! Mulch.

BoJack: Listen, Wanda. I think maybe there's some things we kind of glossed over as we rushed into this relationship. We don't know each other at all. Maybe we should take a step back and—

Wanda: BoJack, watch out!

BoJack & Wanda: (together) Aah!!

Deer: Oh, no!

Wanda: What was that?

BoJack: A stick? Tree branch? Nothing?

Wanda: I heard someone scream, "Oh, no."

BoJack: Yeah, that's the sound a stick makes when you hit it with your car. Fine. I'll see if the stick's okay. Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the road? Are you crazy?

Deer:(groaning and grunting)

Wanda: BoJack, we just hit a deer. We have to get him to a hospital.

BoJack: He's fine. He's in the woods. You know, you hit a deer and they limp off to the woods to— continue living their lives. What are you doing?

Wanda: I'm going to find him and I'm going to help him.

BoJack: Hey, if you wanna go for a walk in the woods at night, go crazy, but I'm not going anywhere. Okay, knock yourself out. I'll wait here, just me and my tunes.

Garrison Keillor: (on the radio) It's A Prairie Home Companion.

BoJack: Oh, no.

Garrison: —marathon —

BoJack: Oof..

Garrison: — for the next 72 hours—

BoJack: Oh, God.

Garrison: — commercial-free—

BoJack: No, thank you.

Garrison: — on every single channel—

BoJack: What?! (sighs) Damn it. (panting) BoJack to the rescue. We should definitely go back. Nothing more we can do here.

Wanda: If you don't wanna do this with me, wait in the car.

BoJack: What is your plan here exactly?

Wanda: Oh.

BoJack: What? What is it?

Wanda: Footprints, 400 yards ahead.

BoJack:: How can you see that far in the dark?

Wanda: I'm an owl.

BoJack: Oh, right. Okay, now you're just showing off.

Wanda: Are you okay? Ow!

Deer: Stay back! There's more pine-cones where that came from.

Wanda: Let us take you to the hospital.

Deer: I can't go back to no hospital. This is the fourth time I've been hit this year.

BoJack: Well, maybe you shouldn't wear camouflage track suits.

Deer: I don't have health care. I didn't pay my bills, so I'm in arrears.

Wanda: A deer in arrears. (laughs) (in English accent) What's that? She can't hear you. She's got a deer in her ears.

BoJack: Look, pal, I'll pay the bill, just—just let us get you to a damn hospital.

Deer:I don't know.

Wanda: (in normal voice) Hey, I know you've been hurt and I know you're afraid. We're all afraid. But you have to trust us. It's gonna be okay.

BoJack: Not standing in the middle of the road will also help, in the future.

Deer: You're not gonna hurt me again?

BoJack: I am not going to hurt you.

Deer: Okay. (shouting)

BoJack: Starting...now.

    HOSPITAL 

Wanda: They said he's gonna be okay.

BoJack: Oh, great. Great.

Wanda: Wanna hear another joke?

BoJack: Well, is it a joke or is it a story? Because I'll listen to another story if you stop calling them jokes.

Wanda: So, there's this couple who just started dating and things are going really well. One day, the girl finds a box of old love letters from her high school boyfriend. She reads them and, like, loves how silly they are. You know, the drama of young romance.

So, on a whim, she sends the letters to her ex-boyfriend thinking he might find them funny too. Well, okay, that night, she tells her current boyfriend about it and he loses his shit. They get in a huge fight about it. He's all, "Why would you send your ex the old love letters? He's going to think you're still in love with him!" And she's just like, "Relax, Brandon!"

BoJack: Is the boyfriend's name Brandon?

Wanda: Yeah, that's the new boyfriend. I forgot to mention that. It doesn't matter. So, anyway, now the night is ruined because Brandon is obsessed. He's like, "That ex-boyfriend's going to come back for you. He knows where you live!" So, after dinner, he drives her home.

She lives in one of those big apartment buildings by the freeway. And he walks her to her door, but he forgets to lock the car and leaves the windows down. He kisses her good night, but things are kind of weird, you know? Then he gets back in his car and starts to drive away, but when he glances in his rear-view mirror, his blood turns cold. Guess what's in the back seat.

BoJack: The ex-boyfriend?

Wanda: No! The bag of mulch!

BoJack: What? Oh—Wow, that is actually a really good joke.

Wanda: I told you. Some things take time.

    Back to the party 

Princess Carolyn: I'll take you home.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Oh, come on, stick around a little.

Princess Carolyn: Nope. I gotta take Todd home. Had a wonderful time. Really. It just flew by. Come on, Todd, get in the car.

Todd: Okay.

Diane: (mumbling)

Mr. Peanutbutter: Um, do you wanna talk about what happened?

Diane: What happened? No, I don't wanna talk about what happened, I just wanna clean up.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Okay.

Diane: Why? What do you think happened?

Mr. Peanutbutter: I just..

Diane: Because what I think happened is that BoJack's girlfriend asked what Tony Curtis was up to and I said, "Tony Curtis died."


Mr. Peanutbutter: Uh..

Diane: And you said, "Did he?"

Mr. Peanutbutter: Right, but..

Diane: And I said, "Yes, he did." And you said, "Really? I'm not sure about that."

Mr. Peanutbutter: Yeah..

Diane: And I said, "Well, I am." And you said, "I'm not so sure." And I said, "I'm telling you, Tony Curtis is dead." And you said, "Let's check the Internet."

Mr. Peanutbutter: No-no

Diane: And I said, "We don't need to check the Internet, I'm telling you he's dead." And you said, "Let's just check though." Is that what you think happened?

Mr. Peanutbutter: So, do you wanna talk about it? Because it kind of feels like you wanna talk about it.

Diane: I don't, understand, why you couldn't just believe that I know something!

Mr. Peanutbutter: I believe you know lots of things. I just thought, what's the harm in checking? Especially since we have these amazing little boxes now with 24-hour access to the world's largest source of information.

Diane: You shouldn't have to check whether or not your wife knows what she's talking about. You humiliated me in front of all my friends. (to a fish-dancer) You can give it a rest. Show's over.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Okay, but don't I get a little bit of credit for inviting all of your friends to an awesome surprise party?

Diane: No, because why did you think I would want an awesome surprise party?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Is it the awesome part you object to or..?

Diane: You always just assume that everyone wants whatever you want. Well, you know what they say about assuming. Makes an ass out of you and—"Ming."

Mr. Peanutbutter: Who's Ming?

Diane: (groans) Ugh!

Mr. Peanutbutter: I'm sorry, Diane. Okay? I'm sorry I threw you a party. What, a, monster. Throwing you a party like some sort of terrorist. Because It's a well-known fact that if you really hate someone, really wanna hit them where it hurts, you throw them a party. That's why when we go to war, we don't drop bombs on the enemy. We drop parties! So, I'm so sorry I threw you an amazing party.

Diane: You didn't throw me an amazing party. You threw you an amazing party. Everything today has been about you.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Really? That picnic we had in the tea garden was about me? That trip to the library was about me? "Women on the Wall: An Exploration of Gender in Text and Media, Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer in conversation with Helen Molesworth" was about me?! Oh, sure. Fine. Just walk away.

Diane: (shouts) Ah!

Mr. Peanutbutter: Oh. So now you're gonna play in the ball pit without me? Real mature, Diane.

Diane: Why does my birthday party have a ball pit?

Mr. Peanutbutter: So I could get these T-shirts made.

Diane: Ugh.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Also, you once told me that when you were a little girl, you dreamed of living in a house that had a ballroom.

Diane: A ballroom is not a room full..

Mr. Peanutbutter: Heads up!

Diane: No!

Mr. Peanutbutter: Yes!

Diane: Ugh. Mr.Peanutbutter, some part of you must have known I wouldn't like any of this.

Mr. Peanutbutter: But I went balls-to-the-wall for this party. Literally, there are balls all the way to the wall.

Diane: Right, but I've told you so many times, I don't like parties.

Mr. Peanutbutter: But it's the thought that counts, right?

Diane: That's exactly—The thought was—Ugh!—What did you do to the spare bedroom?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Every room at this party has a theme. And this room's theme is Starbucks.

Diane: Starbucks is not a theme.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Can we not fight in Starbucks? I don't wanna be a couple who fights at Starbucks.

Diane: Okay. Fine. You did go all out.

Mr. Peanutbutter: I really thought you'd like this. I know you love Starbucks.

Diane: I don't love Starbucks..

Mr. Peanutbutter: You don't love Starbucks, you love the independent coffee place, Starbucks is more convenient.

Diane: Yeah.

Mr. Peanutbutter: See? I do sometimes listen. Can I get you a decaf Americano?

Diane: Sure. I know you put a lot of thought into today and I appreciate that, really..

Mr. Peanutbutter: I have a decaf Americano on the bar for Darren. Is there a Darren here? Says Darren on the cup.

Diane: Thank you. This is very realistic.

Mr. Peanutbutter: I know, right? You wanna go check out the pool? I filled it up with Jell-O.

    The Pool 

Diane: Ah—I still can't believe I'm 35.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Would you believe I'm 35?

Diane: (chuckles) I'm still mad at you.

Mr. Peanutbutter: I know.

Diane: But I don't wanna be.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Well, I don't want you to be mad at me either. We only have so many days together. I want everyone to be a happy one.

Diane: Oh, my God. You don't want me to go to Cordovia.

Mr. Peanutbutter: What?!

Diane: You don't think I know what it means when you say shit like "We only have so many days together?"

Mr. Peanutbutter: Uh, what?!

Diane: "Diane, I love waking up next to you."

Mr. Peanutbutter: uh..

Diane: "Diane, I wish every day could be like this."

Mr. Peanutbutter: Yeah, but..

Diane: "Just the two of us, together." Do you have any idea how that feels when I'm trying to plan my trip?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Okay. You got me! Maybe I don't want my wife, whom I love, to go off on a terrifying six-month tour of the most war-torn, disease-splattered corners of the planet with a charming, handsome, billionaire bachelor. What could I be thinking? I'm such a terrible husband!

Diane: I'm not happy!

Mr. Peanutbutter: With—me?

Diane: I don't know. With everything. I wake up in the morning and I feel like I have no purpose. And I'm 35. And if I don't make some change in my life, then this is how I'm gonna feel forever.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Honey...

Diane: But then I think about Sebastian St.Clair and going to work with him, helping people and making a difference. And I feel like I have a reason to get out of bed.

Mr. Peanutbutter: I didn't know you felt that way. If you told me that, I would have heard it.

Diane: Mr.Peanutbutter, you know I love you and think you're a good dog. Yes, you are. Yes, you are, and I love your cute, funny face, but I don't wanna be one of those couples that settle into a routine and never changes.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Well, I don't know what to say because I'm an old dog and I'm not gonna change. Do you know what I do while you're at work all day?

Mr. Peanutbutter: I mostly just sit right there. Sometimes I pretend to dig a little hole and then I take a nap. And when I hear your car in the driveway, it is the best part of my day. I mean, I go insane.

Diane: I know, and I love you so much, but you're never going to be my only priority like that. That's just not how I'm wired. I need to also live my life.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Well—okay.

Diane: Is it okay? If I change and try new things and you still love me? And you just stay the same person you've always been and I still love you?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Uh, yeah, that sounds good to me. Does that work for you?

Diane: Yeah, I think that works. Just don't throw me any more surprise parties, okay?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Uh, yeah, noted.

Diane: I can't believe you got me a ball pit.

Mr. Peanutbutter: And you're saying no part of you wants to go jump in that ball pit right now?

Diane: Well, maybe a little. Does that make me a hypocrite?

Mr. Peanutbutter: No, it just means you changed. It's one of the things I love about you.

Paul McCartney: Surprise! Hello? Anybody? This is Paul McCartney. I came all this way to jump out of a cake? Honest. With a new suit on—Aye-yai-yai. 

Man: Son, did you do your homework?

Boy One: I don't wanna do my homework!

Man: (clucks) What, what, what?!

Boy One: I want Chicken 4 Dayz!

Man: Oh— (rapper)

    Oh, it's Chicken 4 Dayz! 
    It's Chicken 4 Dayz! 
    Everybody's having fun At Chicken 4 Dayz! 

Boy One: I got a drumstick!

Girl: I got a arm.

Boy Two: I got a bucket full of mystery stuff!

(rapper)

    Chicken-4-Dayzy, totally crazy! 
    Don't ask questions, just keep eating! 

    Gentle Farm Ad 

Farmer: Over at Chicken-4-Dayz, they pump their chickens full of hormones and keep them cooped up in tiny cages. Now, as a chicken, this concerns me. Here at Gentle Farms, we treat our livestock differently. Lush fields, plenty of dignity, and Foosball. (chuckles) The chickens here have wonderful lives before we harvest them, so you can eat them.

Farmer's kid: But wait, Pa, aren't we chickens? I don't wanna get eaten!

Farmer: Boy, these animals aren't like us. They're specifically bred to be eaten, and genetically modified for maximum flavor. When our chicks first hatch, we lovingly inject them with natural delicious hormones, which makes them meat, thereby erasing any moral gray area! Now you can feel good about eating our meat. It's simple: No one knows chicken like chickens. Gentle Farms.

    BoJack's car, BEVERLY HILLS 

BoJack: Why put the "Skip Ad" button so late? I'm not skipping now. I'm invested.

Diane: BoJack, you're driving a car right now.

BoJack: Oh, right!

Diane: Aah!

BoJack: Oh! Whoa!

(tires screech, then crashing, horn honks)

Becca: (clucking)

Robin & Blue Ray: (cawing)

    MMM, Secretariat Set 

BoJack: Kelsey, ray of sunshine. And who's this little drop of Jupiter?

Kelsey Jannings: This is my daughter, Irving.

BoJack: Your daughter's name is Irving?

Irving Jannings: Gender-normative names are oppressive.

BoJack: Well, aren't you a little princess? What are you doing here outside of the castle?

Irving: Mom, your friend is being weird.

Kelsey: BoJack is not my friend.

BoJack: Whoa!

Kelsey: Diane, I need you to handle Irving.

Diane: Handle her?

Kelsey: It's Take Your Daughter To Work Day. I took my daughter to work, she got empowered, and now I need you to take my daughter away from work, so I can actually do some.

Irving: Mom, don't pawn me off onto your assistant.

Kelsey: Can you not fight me on this, please? Take my car and my daughter, and go do whatever it is you do.

BoJack: Way to delegate, captain! Down low! Nope? Look down. Just put your eyes down. My hand is below your eye line. No?

Diane: I guess you're stuck with me, kiddo.

Irving: Sounds great, old-woman-o.

    Princess Carolyn at her niece's wedding 

(cell phone chips)

Princess Carolyn: (on the phone) What is it, BoJack? I'm at my dumb niece's wedding. Not you, honey! I'm talking about a different dumb niece.

BoJack: I feel like Kelsey doesn't like me.

Princess Carolyn: Well, you're not really the kind of person people like.

BoJack: Right away?

Princess Carolyn: Uh, sure.

BoJack: But once they get to know me, they adore me?

Princess Carolyn: Oh, how do I put this delicately? No.

BoJack: The problem is we haven't gotten any one-on-one time. There are always other people around. Filming me. Feeding me. Walking me to the garage at night, because one time I saw a bag in the wind and I got spooked.

Princess Carolyn: BoJack, the only reason you want Kelsey to like you is because she's cold and distant. Any time someone tries to love you, you shove them away.

BoJack: What? No, I don't, stupid. You're stupid. Don't be such a dumb stupid idiot, Todd.

Princess Carolyn: Okay, I gotta go. Everyone's staring at me for some reason. What? I'm ready. Let's take a picture.

    Mr. Peanutbutter's house 

Mr. Peanutbutter: Hear ye! Hear ye! I call this meeting of P.B.Livin' to order. I believe it was Benjamin Franklin who said: "You have reached the end of your free trial membership at Benjamin-Franklin-Quotes.com."

Todd: What a wise man.

Mr. Peanutbutter: What's on the agenda, my frienda?

Todd: Well, here's an idea. What if there was a West Dakota?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Todd, isn't that a job for the State Department?

Todd: Well, I got a whole page of other ideas, each as impractical as they are prohibitively expensive.

Mr. Peanutbutter: You know what they say: "You gotta spend money to make money." So, how can I spend a lot of money? I know. I'll take a spa day.

Todd: Uh—

Mr. Peanutbutter: Eyes, prepare to receive cucumbers.

Todd: We're in a meeting.

Mr. Peanutbutter: You know what they say: "You gotta skip meetings to have meetings." See ya'.

Todd: Wait, what should I do?

Mr. Peanutbutter: I don't know. Oh, maybe you could go on one of your silly Todd adventures. You know, whatever you do when everyone is busy with other stuff.

Todd: (sighs) Okay.

    Wedding 

(cell phone chips)

Princess Carolyn: (on the phone) What is it, Todd?

Todd: Princess Carolyn, I need something to do. A job, or a task, or a direction in life—You're my agent. Can you give my life meaning?

Princess Carolyn: I really don't have time for this. Well, don't stop on my account.

Todd: Princess Carolyn, do I have a purpose?

Princess Carolyn: Oh, purpose? Are you high?

Todd: Only the normal amount.

Princess Carolyn: Okay, look, I gotta go. They're about to step on the glass. Just stay out of trouble.

Becca: (clucking)

Todd: Uh, okay.

    BEVERLY HILLS 

(horn honks, siren whoops, dog sniffs)

Meow Meow Fuzzyface: What I want is a hard target search of every gas station, backyard, outhouse, pool house— And can I get a black-and-white cookie, if it's not too G.D. troublesome? So, we know the chicken crossed the road. But the real mystery is—why?

    Kelsey's car 

Diane: So, Irving, what do you want to be when you grow up?

Irving: First I'm gonna go to Brown, then I'm gonna go to Yale Law.

Diane: Wow.

Irving: Then I'm gonna be the youngest ever Supreme Court Justice.

Diane: That's great.

Irving: Or, you know, something in marketing.

Diane: Wow. Would you mind if we stopped by my house? I have to do a lot of laundry.

Irving: So, you just, like, do laundry? That's, like, your thing?

Diane: Okay. This whole attitude you're putting on? I must be Shania Twain, because that don't impress me much.

Irving: Is that a reference from the '90s? You know that was twenty years ago, right?

Diane: Hey, I was just like you when I was a teenager. I was this badass overachiever that had these big plans to change the world.

Irving: Yeah? What happened?

Diane: Oh, you didn't hear? I changed the world.

    PB's house 

Becca: (clucking)

Todd: (whistling) Did you have a nice shower? I made you a sandwich. Oh, but it has turkey in it. Is that kind of weird?

Becca: (clucking)

(doorbell rings)

Fuzzyface: Police!

Todd: (gulps) Oh, man. (sighs) What seems to be the problem? Officer—

Fuzzyface: Fuzzyface. Meow Meow Fuzzyface. A Chicken 4 Dayz chicken fell off a back of a truck, and I gotta find her and take her to the slaughterhouse. You haven't seen any chickens running around, have you?

Todd: No, I don't think so.

Becca: (clucking)

Fuzzyface: Who's this?

Todd: Uh, this is my, uh— My wife—

Becca: (clucking)

Todd: Becca! Yeah, my wife Becca. Becca Chavez. There she is.

Becca: (clucking)

Fuzzyface: Okay.

Becca: (clucking)

Todd: Yep, she loves her books. Big reader. (chuckles) Real nerd.

Becca: (clucking)

Todd: Back off? Okay, I'm sorry, honey.

Fuzzyface: Hold on, if you're really a nerd, who's your favorite Baroque composer?

Becca: (clucking)

Fuzzyface: Bach? Not Vivaldi? You're insane!

Becca: (clucking)

Fuzzyface: Yes, I am holding a Bic pen, but I don't see how that's relevant, Mrs.Chavez.

Becca: (clucking)

Fuzzyface: Sorry. Becca.

Becca: (clucking)

Fuzzyface: She's a charming woman. I do have to look around a little bit, just so I can say I did my job.

Todd: Uh, don't you need a warrant?

Fuzzyface: Only if you're guilty.

(pause, both chuckling)

Todd: Well, in that case, mi casa es su casa.

(both chuckling)

Todd: (to Becca) So, if anyone asks, you were born in La Jolla. You majored in Communications at USC, and now you're the booking agent for Kings of Leon.

Becca: (clucking)

Todd: Fine, you also book Beck.

Diane: Todd?

Todd: Aah! I didn't find that thing in your drawer!

Diane: Why are the police outside?

Todd: Okay. I met this chicken and she escaped from Chicken 4 Dayz factory, and she doesn't speak English, but she's my best friend and the cops are looking for her, and Mr.Peanutbutter went to the spa, and I love her, and her name is Becca.

Becca: (clucking)

Todd: Chickenson.

Diane: Todd, breathe.

Todd: But we can't send Becca back. They're gonna pump her full of hormones.

Becca: (clucking)

Todd: More hormones. I have a plan, but we gotta get her out of here right now.

Diane: Todd, no. Becca doesn't belong to you.

Todd: But she needs our help.

Diane: Do you know how much trouble we'd get in? There's a policeman in our front yard.

Irving: Uh-oh, here comes the responsible suburban housewife. Gonna do whatever the man says.

Diane: (sighs) You're right. Let's get out of here.

Irving: So, now you're just gonna do whatever a teenage girl says? Jeezy kableezy, grow a spine.

Becca: (clucking)

Irving: Yeah, or a backbone. Thank you, Becca.

Diane: (groans) Ugh—

Fuzzyface: Here chicken, chicken, chicken.

Todd: Oh, oh.

Becca: (clucking)

Todd: Well, we're off to the beach. Just me and my wife, and our teenage daughter and our maid.

Diane: What? Why am I a maid?

Todd: Silence, maid! Honey, do you want to sit in the front or the back?

Becca: (clucking)

Todd: And why not? Maid, you can drive.

Diane: Ugh—

Todd: Hope there's not too much traffic on the 134. Okay, bye-bye, officer.

Fuzzyface: So long. Have a great day. (pause) Wait a second. The 134 doesn't go to the beach. Unless you took it to the 10. But then why wouldn't you take the 405 to the 10? Hold on, this pen isn't a Bic. No, no, this doesn't add up at all. Wait! That man's wife was a—chicken!!

    MSNBSea (news theme music plays) 

Tom Jumbo-Grumbo: Fowl run afoul. A funky chicken has flown the coop, and for a concerned populace, the sky is falling. Michael Morgan, Chicken 4 Dayz CEO, this is a public safety hazard, and your company is responsible. Admit it, you counted your chickens before they hatched, and now, those chickens have come home to roost.

Michael Morgan: Tom, I want to take full responsibility for this mishap. That's why, for a limited time, everybody, we are offering our special Full Responsibility Poppers at participating restaurants for only $4.99.

Tom: Tell me, though, if one sees this delicious escaped chicken in the street, should they approach it, or—?

Michael: Oh, no. I want to be very clear that this is not like a friend chicken you see at school or work. This is a special kind of food chicken that has lived its entire life indoors. This chicken is not socialized for the outside world.

Tom: Sounds like my ex-wife. Hey-yo!

Michael: (chuckles) Oh, Tommy. Look, the safest place for this chicken right now is with us, so we can kill it, turn it into a sludge, and then press that sludge into a delicious patty.

Tom: I'd like to take this moment to apologize for the earlier crack about my ex-wife. Shannon, we shared 14 beautiful years together. (to Michael) How do you respond to allegations that factory farming is "torture," or "cruel," or "like a terrifying movie about some strange dystopian society, but in this monster story, the horrifying monsters are us"?

Michael: Relax, Tommy, everything we do is completely legal and FDA-approved, so, therefore, it is fine.

Tom: I have no follow-up questions.

    Kelsey's car 

Diane: Okay, Todd, what's your plan?

Todd: What?

Diane: You said you had a plan?

Todd: Oh yeah, my plan was: Ask Diane for help. And now my plan has been completed. Nice follow-through, Todd.

Diane: We have a 'roided out chicken in our car and the cops on the lookout. What are we gonna do?

Irving: Hey, geniuses, why don't we take her to Gentle Farms?

Todd: Yeah, no one knows chicken like chickens! They couldn't say that in the ad if it wasn't true.

Becca: (clucking)

Todd: Yeah! Book Beck. You remember.

Diane: (groans) Ugh—

"Have you seen This Chicken?"

    SET 

Kelsey: And cut! Company move to—

BoJack: Great news, blue-collar types. Instead of crew lunch today, your star has arranged for his favorite burrito truck to bring you lunch. It's me, I'm that star!

(all cheering)

Kelsey: BoJack, we're not breaking for lunch yet.

BoJack: Or we could break for lunch, and you and I could get to know each other.

Kelsey: The crew has more work to do. Once they've had a burrito, they'll be off their circadian rhythm— (cell phone rings) What?

Fuzzyface: (on the phone) Los Angeles P.D. Are you the owner of a 2002 Volvo with a "Reelect Al Gore" bumper sticker?

Kelsey: As relevant today as it was then.

Fuzzyface: Are you aware said Volvo is currently harboring a fugitive chicken, along with a teenage girl, a small, sprite-like man, and a maid of some sort?

Kelsey: That's my daughter! Not the maid. The other one.

Fuzzyface: I'd wager they're making a run for Gentle Farms. Don't worry, though. We'll bring your daughter home, dead or alive.

Kelsey: Alive! Alive!

Fuzzyface: We're the L.A.P.D., ma'am. We'll probably make the right call.

Kelsey: Wait, wait, wait—

    L.A.P.D. 

Fuzzyface: All right, troops, listen up! I'm ready to go after these rabble-rousers with all—

Police Chief: Oh, no! Not until you get a warrant!

Fuzzyface: Ah, damn it, I hate due process!

Police Chief: You're a loose cannon, Meow Meow Fuzzyface.

Fuzzyface: No, I'm not. I'm a cannon, maybe, but a loose cannon? Is that what you think of me?

Cop Two: I think you play by your own rules.

Cop Three: No way, he thinks rules were made to be broken.

Police Chief: These are all attributes of a loose cannon.

Fuzzyface: No, I'm just a reckless renegade. Sergeant Stone's a loose cannon.

Sergeant Stone: Aah! You shut your trap, Fuzzyface!

Cop Three: I'd say Stone's more of a cop on the edge with nothing to lose. That's an entirely different thing.

Cop Two: Now I'm just confused. Is Meow Meow Fuzzyface a loose cannon or not?

Police Chief: All right, put on a pot of coffee. We're gonna get to the bottom of this.

Sergeant Stone: (groans)

Fuzzyface: Aw, man.

    SET 

Woman: So full of burrito.

Man: Ooh.

BoJack: Uh-oh, siesta time.

Kelsey: I need to go. Irving ran off with a fugitive chicken in my car.

BoJack: We can take my car. This is perfect.

Kelsey: Why is this perfect? My daughter could be in danger.

BoJack: Yes, I agree, but we can use the car ride to get some one-on-one. I mean, who is BoJack?

Kelsey: I'm sure I can find another ride.

BoJack: Every second you waste finding another ride, your daughter gets another second closer to getting her eyes poked out by a deranged mutant chicken, or worse, death, or slightly better, teen pregnancy, or worse again, salmonella.

Kelsey: Okay, fine. Let's go.

BoJack: Yay! I'm calling this road trip the 007, because we are gonna bond. Up top? Down low? Either one? Both?

    Gentle Farms Chicken 

Diane: Oh, wow, you guys have a movie night here?

Todd: Oh—

Farmer: And we have 20 acres of pasture, where our chickens have hours of free play.

Diane: See, Todd? She'll be happy here.

Farmer: She sure will.

Farmer and his kid: Because no one knows chicken like chickens.

Farmer's Kid: Thank you for saving this poultry from a terrible life at a factory farm. You're a hero.

Todd: But what if Chicken 4 Dayz tries to get her back?

Farmer: Oh, Don't you worry about your friend. That chicken belongs to us now.

Diane: Whoa! Where'd you get that gun?

Farmer: You mean originally, or just now?

Diane: Just now.

Farmer: It was in that barrel.

Irving: And what about originally?

Farmer: Also that barrel.

Todd: Look, Becca, I know this is hard to understand, but I have to go, and you can't come with me.

Becca: (clucking)

Todd: No, no, you don't need to book Beck anymore. Now you can just be a chicken. See, this is where you belong, okay? You hear me? I don't want you no more. You weren't the best friend I ever had, and I never loved you! Now get, Becca!! I said get!! (sobbing)

Becca: (clucking)

Diane: She really stretched out that dress.

    BoJack's car 

BoJack: She was so horrified, she checked into rehab. So, I'm kind of the reason Drew Barrymore got sober. Did you like Never Been Kissed? because If so, you're welcome.

Kelsey: Can we have one conversation that isn't about you? I don't understand why you need me to like you so much.

BoJack: I don't need you to like me. It would be fun if you liked me, because I'd prove to myself that my parents were wrong to never support me, because I now earned the admiration of an authority figure, thus proving I have intrinsic worth, but it's not a big deal or anything. Jeez.

Kelsey: Great story, BoJack. You should put that in a podcast, so I can unsubscribe. Can this piece of junk go any faster?

BoJack: It's been acting screwy since I hit that deer a couple weeks back. Probably should get it checked out.

(tire blows, both yelling)

Kelsey: (sighs)

BoJack: Probably should've gotten it checked out.

    Kelsey's car 

Diane: Those farmers seem nice.

Todd: Yeah. I think Becca will be really happy there.

Diane: She'll have a nice life.

Todd: Yeah, until they—kill her.

Diane: Well, yeah, but of all the places that will eventually kill her, Gentle Farms seems like the best.

Todd: This doesn't feel right. Becca was our friend. No. We gotta get her back.

Irving: Uh, what do you mean? Remember when that guy cocked his gun and said: "That chicken belongs to us now"? He wasn't doing that because he likes cocking guns.

Todd: Then we'll just bust her out1

Diane: Todd, there's nothing we can do. Where else would Becca go? She doesn't even speak English.

Todd: Well, we gotta do something. Look, I know I'm a screw-up and all my ideas are terrible, but with Becca, I was responsible for something. I had a purpose. Ah. I guess you wouldn't understand.

Diane: (groans)

(tires screeching, Irving and todd yell)

Irving: Oh, my God, Diane!

Diane: All right. Let's bust her out.

Todd: Yes! Okay, and afterwards, will you get me an iPad?

Diane: What? No.

Todd: But I really want an iPad. Maybe you wouldn't understand.

Diane: Don't push it.

    L.A.P.D. 

Police Chief: All right, all right, we've agreed. He's a loose cannon, but he gets results.

Fuzzyface: I can live with that.

Police Chief: Now, you go bust those perps. You'll need a maverick, a by-the-book rookie, and a curmudgeonly veteran one week from retirement. Go, go, go!

    MSBNSea (news theme music plays) 

Tom: We have received word that authorities are now en route to Gentle Farms in an attempt to preempt the pursued poultry at the pass. Do we have a graphic for this? No? Where's the graphic? No, I'm not gonna go on until we have a graphic. So, make one. I'll wait. Yeah, hold on, America, Randy's gotta figure out how to do his job. Because if I don't have a graphic, Randy, people who are just tuning in— Why am I explaining this to you? This is basic journalistic—I swear to God! We'll be right back!

    BoJack's car 

BoJack: Just got to place the jack in the right jack apparatus. There, I have got— No, just kidding, I have no idea what I'm doing. That was me, acting. Pretty convincing performance, huh? Perhaps there's more to me—

Kelsey: Are you capable of experiencing a single moment that you don't then make about you? What was your plan to get out of here?

BoJack: I don't know. Some hick'll come by at some point, and I'll give him an autograph in exchange for a tow. Boom, his life's changed, and you and I are on our way.

Kelsey: Oh, my God. I'm going to lose custody of my daughter. The only reason I took this movie is for her. This is my one shot at a big studio movie. And if I blow it, I'm back to making small, critically acclaimed movies about lesbians learning how to recycle. You think I want to be an indie darling? Who's gonna fund Irving's education? Marla? With her seasonal nut butters?

BoJack: Yeah, Marla sucks, right?

Kelsey: Indie-darling daughters don't go to Brown, okay? They end up at cute pat-on-the-back factories like Vassar, and then move back in with their indie-darling mothers and make weird puppet shows with their tampons, and they get a profile in New York Magazine, and the horrible cycle continues. Oh, my God, I'm a terrible mother.

BoJack: Hey, I know terrible mothers, and you're not a terrible mother.

Hick: Hey, aren't you the horse from Horsin' Around? And you're the director of Women Who Love Women Who Love Recycling. Give you a lift in exchange for a couple autographs.

BoJack: There he is. Right on time.

    Gentle Farms 

Todd: Shh, shh, shh. Everyone keep quiet. We gotta—Ooh. Whoa, whoa, whoa! (grunting)

(wind chimes tinkling, gong sounds)

Todd: They probably didn't hear that. Uh, that's probably a coincidence.

Farmer: Someone broke onto the farm!

Todd: Maybe they're rehearsing a one-act play called Someone Broke Onto the Farm and someone just said the titular line?

(door opens)

Diane: (gasps) This way.

Irving: Oh.

Diane: Irving, this isn't safe. Get in the car, lock the doors. Don't try to be a badass and argue with me—

Irving: Yeah, okay, bye!

Diane: Okay. Go, go, go!

Todd: (panting)

(clucking)

Todd: Uh—

(clucking)

Todd: Becca?

Farmer: Who's making that ruckus in my chicken coop?

    Roosting coop 

(all clucking loudly)

Todd: Becca, where are you?

Diane: Becca, are you? Becca?

Todd: Is this you?

Becca: (clucking)

Todd: Becca?

Becca: To—To—Todd?

Todd: Oh, I found her! Diane! This one's Becca!

Diane: No! Todd! Don't you get it? They're all Becca.

Todd: Oh.

Diane: Okay, go, chickens! You're free. Go, run to freedom! For generations they will tell your story!

Farmer: Who goes there?

Todd: Oh, oh, oh, shit!

Diane: We gotta hide!

Todd: Go, go, go! (panting) Hide, hide! In here! Someplace safe. Come on, come on. Oh, no!

Becca: (clucking)

Diane: Shh, shh. Becca, no, no, no!

Todd: Shh.

Farmer: Only we know how to care for these creatures, you hear? Like I say: "No one knows chicken like chickens." (cocks gun, laughs)

Todd: Oh, Diane, I'm sorry I got you into this.

Diane: (sighs) It's not your fault.

Todd: I don't know why I always get into these—messes. You know, sometimes I feel like my whole life is just a series of loosely-related wacky misadventures.

Diane: I think that's just what being in your 20s is.

Todd: Really?

Diane: Yeah. I'm supposed to be the adult here, and I'm a total mess.

Todd: are You kidding? You're the coolest person I know.

Diane: Really?

Todd: Yeah. And you always know what to do, and you don't take shit from anyone.

Diane: Is that how you see me?

Todd: Of course. You're like Lara Croft. In Diane's body.

Farmer: (cocks gun)

Todd: (whimpering)

Diane: Alright, this is our chance. Let's go!

Todd: Come on, Becca!

Diane: Go, go, go!

(all gasping)

Farmer's Wife: Please. Take me with you. I hate it here. I don't want to kill chickens. I want to design video games that help kids learn math.

Todd: Oh—

Irving: Whoa!

Diane: I am—so sorry.

Becca: (clucking)

Todd: Okay, that was crazy! Just go. Let's get out of here!

Diane: We're free, we're free!

Irving: Oh, shit.

(siren whoops, tires screech)

Fuzzyface: Well, well, looks like birds of a feather— go to jail.

Becca: (clucking)

Todd: Why was he wearing sunglasses at night?

    Hollywoo hills Super-max 

Fuzzyface: I hope you folks like community service.

Diane: I do.

Fuzzyface: What? Oh.

Kelsey: Oh, my God, Irving, thank God you're safe.

Irving: Mom, I'm fine. Stop embarrassing me in front of my cool friends.

Diane: What? Cool? I mean— that's cool that you think I'm cool. I don't care or anything, but, you know, it's cool.

Kelsey: Hey, this guy. What'd you get arrested for? Being too cute?

Todd: (chuckles)

Kelsey: I want to be in his cell.

BoJack: Listen up, everybody. I, famous celebrity BoJack Horseman, have an announcement. I'm gonna ask you to drop all charges against my friends on account of me being a celebrity. We gracefully accept the requisite slap on the wrist and a brief, but ultimately pointless, trial in the court of public opinion. Good day.

Fuzzyface: Well, you are famous, so you are all free to go.

Sergeant Stone: (yells)

Todd: But what about Becca?

BoJack: Took care of that, too. Called in a favor with Drew Barrymore, and she'll pay off Chicken 4 dayz to adopt your feathered friend.

Todd: Does she have a meadow that Becca can frolic around in?

BoJack: You think Drew Barrymore doesn't have a frolicking meadow? That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. You know, I learned something today. Sometimes, when you think something isn't about you, you find a way to save the day and in the end of the day realize that it was, all along, all about you.

Kelsey: (groans) Ugh!

BoJack: Plus, I got you all a burrito truck!

All: Hooray!

BoJack: Yay! I'm great!

    Kelsey's car 

Irving: So, after all that, the only thing that saved Becca was that BoJack was friends with Drew Barrymore?

BoJack: Yep.

Irving: So, did anything we did matter?

BoJack: Nope.

Diane: I think it did. I think we made a difference. A small one, but a difference.

Todd: Yeah, I think we did, too. I think we really changed things for the better.

Oxnard: As your accountant, I felt it necessary to do this in person.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Us, too. Because we're really accounting on you—

Oxnard: Oh, no.

Mr. Peanutbutter: —to get in on the ground floor of this exciting new—

Oxnard: No-no, don't do this. Please, God, no.

Mr. Peanutbutter: —PB Livin' product.

Todd: Has this ever happened to you?

Oxnard: No-no-no, whatever it is, it hasn't happened. Nothing has ever happened to me. Stop.

Mr. Peanutbutter: You say you love a toasted bagel.

Oxnard: I would never say that. I have celiac disease.

Todd: Ding. Bagel's ready—

Oxnard: Oh, no.

Todd: —but wait—

Oxnard: Son of a—Hey!

Todd: —that bagel was too fast.

Mr. Peanutbutter: That's why PB Livin' presents, the Bagel Catcher. For all those hard-to-catch bagels.

Oxnard: No, no. Stop. Enough. Enough. Stop talking! I can't take it anymore! PB Livin' is filing for bankruptcy! I'm shutting you down.

Todd: I thought you were a customer. I don't get what's happening.

Oxnard: What's happening is you two knuckleheads threw thousands of dollars into a bunch of dumb ideas. You paid 50 grand to a bunch of kindergartners for the movie rights to the game "Tag."

Mr. Peanutbutter: Our business manager was over the moon for that one.

Oxnard: Business manager? Who the hell is your business manager?!

    CUT 

Vincent Adultman: Business-wise, this all seems like appropriate business.

Oxnard: You two are done. This company is more in the red than Carrie on prom night.

Mr. Peanutbutter: So, what you're saying is, we're just one great idea away from breaking even?

Oxnard: No. You're—(groans) You are out of money. Mr.Peanutbutter, you need to get a job.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Are you hiring at your accounting firm?

Oxnard: Dude, no.

Mr. Peanutbutter: I'm waiting for my agent. He'll be with me any moment. Mr.Peanutbutter is going back to work. (LATER) He's probably just organizing all the amazing opportunities. I haven't heard from him in years, so they've probably been piling up. (LATER) Maybe I should just go check on 'im. Hello, Ronnie? It's your favorite client, Mr.Peanutbutter. Well, I'm coming in. I hope you're— Oh! Oh, my God. Ronnie, how'd you get that belt stuck around your neck, then caught on the filing cabinet, which made your pants fall down while you were researching pornograph— Oh, I see what happened here.

    BoJack's House 

Both: (on TV, unison) Morning time, Hollywoo.

A Ryan Seacrest Type: I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.

Some Lady: And I'm Some Lady. Here's a thing written on a card. Last night, major Hollywoo agent Ronnie Bonito was found dead in his office—

A Ryan: Ruh-roh.

Some Lady: —in what authorities are calling a mishap of a sexual nature.

A Ryan: What does that mean?

Some Lady: You know, auto-erotic asphyxiation.

A Ryan: Auto-a-what's it who's it? Oh, is that that thing where you strangle yourself in an attempt to heighten sexual arousal?

Some Lady: It sure is.

A Ryan: (spitting)

(both laughing)

Some Lady: Coming up, a food truck that serves just one thing: gravy.

BoJack: Did you hear that? New food truck. We should go.

Wanda: I'm in.

Todd: Hey, can I get some lunch money? It's pizza day today.

BoJack: Sure thing, sport. Wait, where is it pizza day?

Todd: In my tummy.

BoJack: Oh, for—

Wanda: Hey, BoJack, would you zip me up? My shoulder is killing me. I'm not sleeping right. We need to do something about that bed. Just because I'm nocturnal doesn't mean I wanna be up all night.

BoJack: I propped it up with a Golden Globe.

Wanda: It still wobbles.

BoJack: Yeah. Anyway, I got you something.

Wanda: Oh. A beeper? BoJack, it's great, but you know, I already have one.

BoJack: Yeah, you have a beeper, but I don't. Now, you can page me whenever you want.

Wanda: Huh. (kissing) BoJack, I love it, and you're gonna love it, too. There's all kinds of codes we can send each other. "Zero, zero, zero" is "call me," and "1-2-3" is "I miss you" and "8-0-0-8-5" is boobs.

BoJack: What? Boobs? Oh, my God. What scamp came up with that one? Okay, I gotta go. Dinner tonight?

Wanda: Totally. Let's hit that gravy truck.

(kissing)

BoJack: Okay, love ya'. (pause) Uh—

Wanda: Uh.

BoJack: No, I don't. Aw—"I love you. No, I don't"? Uh— Keys. Uh-oh. Get out.


    VIGOR 

Princess Carolyn: Hold it. Hold the elevator. Ooh. Ah. Ee. Ow. Goddamit. No. No. Ow. Oh. Ow. Oh—

Rutabaga: Coffee? Hup.

Princess Carolyn: Rutabaga, this day already sucks. My heel broke while I was at this new food truck, and I spilled a handful of gravy all over myself because they don't sell bowls, just gravy.

Rutabaga: Should've gone to the bowl truck first. That's where they get ya'.

Princess Carolyn: Well, I guess the upside to being invisible around here is that none of these assholes will ever notice what a mess I am.

Rutabaga: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I see what a mess you are.

Princess Carolyn: Aw—

Rutabaga: Do you need the movie-star speech?

Princess Carolyn: No, no, I'll be okay. And how are you?

Rutabaga: I gotta look at paint for the new kitchen. I have to pick a shade that won't clash with the splatter of blood from when I blow my brains out after talking to Katie about paint swatches all day. (chuckles) We do have fun.


    Mr. Peanutbutter's House 

Diane: So, what's the plan for today? Find a new agent, go on auditions?

Mr. Peanutbutter: No, I'm gonna do exactly what landed me Mr.Peanutbutter's House, oh, so long ago. Wander around L.A. with an open mind and an empty stomach until I get discovered.

Diane: But also, like, find a new agent and go on auditions, right? Or should I start stealing food from work?

Mr. Peanutbutter: I'm just gonna go with the flow and leave everything up to destiny. "Que sera quesadilla."

Diane: You know we could lose the house, right?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Diane.

Diane: Right?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Diane, Diane, Diane. Diane—

    Secretariat Set 

BoJack: Diane—

Diane: Aah! I wasn't stealing paper towels to use as dinner napkins. Why?

BoJack: Here's a funny question for you: If Mr. Peanutbutter said, "I love you. No, I don't," would you need to talk about that later and figure out what he meant by that? Probably not, right? Because they're meaningless words? I mean, language evolves, right? How can anyone know what anything means? The answer is nobody can and nothing means anything, so why bother talking about anything, right?

Diane: In this scenario, are Mr. Peanutbutter and I living in our house? Or are we squatting in an abandoned Barnes & Noble burning books to keep warm as we struggle through our Dickensian-style poverty?

BoJack: Uh—"Zero, zero, zero." No idea what that means.

Diane: I think it means "call me."

BoJack: Ignore. Wait, where's the ignore button? How do I ignore?

Diane: I think with a beeper, you just ignore it.

BoJack: With what, my mind?!

Diane: You seem a little stressed out.

BoJack: Well, that's just because as soon as I'm done with work, I have to have a long, awkward conversation with Wanda about our relationship, unless I'm never done with work. Diane, you magnificent bastard. That's it.

    MOVIE 

Corduroy: (acts) I'll be out there in the stands. And I'll be rooting for you, Secretariat.

BoJack: (acts) Mm. Yeah. Oh—

Kelsey: Your line is, "And I'll see you at the finish line."

BoJack: Yeah, I know. I'm acting. Great. Now I gotta start all over. Settle in, folks. We could be here a while.

Kelsey: Ow!

    VIGOR 

Princess Carolyn: Ooh.

Mr. Witherspoon: Ah, Princess Carolyn. So good of you to join us eventually.

Princess Carolyn: Sorry I'm late. I had the worst morning.

Mr. Witherspoon: You know who had an even "the worst-er" morning? Ronnie Bonito. Because he's dead.

Princess Carolyn: He is?

Mr. Witherspoon: He decided to strangle the dirty dangle and now that sweet chariot has come for to carry him home. Everyone who was here on time is taking a moment.

Princess Carolyn: Of silence?

Mr. Witherspoon: Yes. Also to reach out to his former clients.

Princess Carolyn: To offer their condolences?

Mr. Witherspoon: Yes. Also to recruit them to the Vigor roster. A Vigor agent is a vigorous agent.

Princess Carolyn: Who do you want me to call? I have ins with a bunch of Bonito's clients including all the major J's: Law, Lo, Leno, and J. Abrams.

Mr. Witherspoon: Oh, that's wonderful news in the parallel universe in which you were on time today. In this reality, however, we're all good. You can lap up the leftovers though.

Princess Carolyn: Mr. Peanutbutter?

Mr. Witherspoon: Oh, and Princess Carolyn? Get your shoe fixed. You look like a woman from an '80s deodorant commercial.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Here I go. Destiny, don't fail me now. Yeah. Hitting the pavement. This is how it happens for a guy like me. Ugh, ew—Out of my way, flyer. Ugh. Flyer. Why do you have to be on my shoe in front of this store? Wait, a second. Shoe. Store. Shoe store? Shoe store! "Team players wanted?" Oh, I'm such a good team player, I make all the other team players look like garbage. Lady Footlocker, meet your lord.

    Secretariat Set 

BoJack: (acts) Finish—(sighs) line.

Kelsey: Great, we got it. We got one take. And now we gotta stop for the day.

BoJack: What? No. Why stop now? I'm just getting warmed up.

Kelsey: Union rules. We're done. Go home.

BoJack: Go home? Why go home when we could extend this long day's journey into night? Drinks on me, folks.

Corduroy: I could use a drink. Or six.

BoJack: Great, Corduroy's driving. Let's go.

    BELLICAN'S 

Corduroy: Ah—I really needed this, BoJack.

BoJack: Me, too.

Corduroy: Yeah, man. This day's been really hard on me. Ever since I heard about that agent who died from that blue-face blastoff?

BoJack: "Blue-face blastoff?"

Corduroy: The strokey chokey? The two-neck squeeze?

BoJack: What?

Corduroy: You know, the one hand on the Adam's apple, the other one's on the Adam's banana?

BoJack: Oh, right. Right. Yeah. The auto-erotic—

Corduroy: That could've been me, you know. I used to really be into that stuff. I was a hardcore gasper.

BoJack: I can't believe you have so many names for it.

Corduroy: And now I can't stop thinking about it. I shouldn't even be alive right now man, you know.

BoJack: we don't need to talk about how you masturbate.

Corduroy: The orgasms you get—

BoJack: Okay, I guess we do.

Corduroy: —it's like seeing a rainbow, but with all the colors.

BoJack: So, like a normal rainbow?

Corduroy: But it's too dangerous, man. They say if you bite down on a lemon right at the point of climax, the lemon juice gives you the jolt you need to not pass out and die. But still man, you're just— rolling the dice.

BoJack: Okay, this is getting really graphic. Can we maybe please talk about anything else?

Corduroy: Sure.

BoJack: Thank God.

Corduroy: Hey, man, it's funny you should mention God, because my new thing is— the Bible.

BoJack: Uh—

Corduroy: Tell me, have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and personal savior?

BoJack: So, noose-wise, what are we talking? You use a standard sailor's knot or more like your average birthday-present bow?

    BoJack's House 

Wanda: I beeped you, BoJack.

BoJack: Oh, hey. About this morning

Wanda: It's fine.

BoJack: Because when I said that—

Wanda: I said it's fine. You don't love me. That's okay. I don't love you.

BoJack: Wha—what?

Wanda: Good night.

    LATER 

Both: Morning time, Hollywoo.

A Ryan: I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.

Some Lady: And I'm Some Lady.

A Ryan: On today's show, I sit down with Hank Hippopopalous to discuss his new smash hit, "Hey, I Think You Can Dance." Can you talk about your process?

Hank: When I see someone, and I think they can dance, I say, "Hey, I think you can dance." And when I think they can't dance, I say, "No, I don't think you can dance." And that is pretty much it.

A Ryan: Fascinating—

BoJack: So, last night when—

Wanda: BoJack, it's not a big deal. You don't love me, I don't love you. We're having a good time. It's fine.

BoJack: You can't just say, "I don't love you" to someone.

Wanda: You said it to me.

BoJack: Yeah, but that was different.

Wanda: How was that different?

BoJack: Because you do love me. Right? Like a little bit?

Wanda: No.

Todd: Uh, for what it's worth, I love both you guys.

BoJack: Shut up, Todd. Grown-ups are talking.

    SHOE-STORE 

Man: Here you go, ma'am.

Mr. Peanutbutter: Jessica Atkinson, come on down.

Princess Carolyn: Mr.Peanutbutter?

Mr. Peanutbutter: Would you like to see what's in box number one or box number two? Either way, it's a brand-new pair of shoes!

    VIGOR 

Princess Carolyn: Oh.

Rutabaga: Hup. Ca-ro-lyn.

Princess Carolyn: Rutabaga

Rutabaga: Coffee? I was thinking about you last night while Katie and I were locked in a fascinating debate about counter granite. And what if I told you I used to work Ronnie Bonito's desk, and I happen to know that he had a client so hush-hush, it wasn't even on the master list.

Princess Carolyn: What?! Who? Tell me. Whoa!

Rutabaga: Beloved novelist J.D. Salinger. Wha-a-t?!

Princess Carolyn: The author of Catcher in the Rye? And—others?

Rutabaga: Yuh-huh.

Princess Carolyn: Isn't he dead?

Rutabaga: He's "reclusive." Dude wanted to be left alone so much, he faked his own death.

Princess Carolyn: Oh, my God. Why are you giving this lead to me?

Rutabaga: Because I like you, dummy.

Princess Carolyn: Huh.

Rutabaga: Now we gotta wait for the fire department to come let us out of this elevator.

    BoJack's Trailer 

Corduroy: Hey.

BoJack: Corduroy, what are you doing here?

Corduroy: I need a favor. Can you hold on to this for me?

BoJack: Ew. Is this your Bible?

Corduroy: No, no, no, no. It's my choking-off kit.

BoJack: Your kit?

Corduroy: Yeah. It has all my supplies. Silk ties, a leather gag, velvet sock, lemon. You gotta take this off my hands. I can't trust myself with this thing.

BoJack: Yeah, I don't know if I want your jack-off kit at my house.

Corduroy: Please, man. I got this girlfriend. She loves me. If I fall back into the old gasp-and-goo, it'll break her heart.

BoJack: Wait. So, you're saying if someone loves you, they don't want you to choke yourself while masturbating?

Corduroy: Yeah. It's really dangerous.

BoJack: All right. I'll take it.

Corduroy: Thanks, BoJack.

BoJack: I still don't understand why you need a kit, though. Can't you just use, like, a belt or a rope?

Corduroy: Oh, I guess. I mean, I guess you could use anything. I mean, you could use an iPhone charger, a shoelace, a necktie, a jump-rope—

    BICYCLE-STORE 

Princess Carolyn: Hm—Oh. Ooh. Oh, hello. I'm looking for some—

J.D. Salinger: Sorry, no looking allowed. This store is for customers only.

Princess Carolyn: Okay, then, I would like to buy a bicycle. What would you recommend? One with a bell, or—?

J.D. Salinger: Alright, you got me. I don't know anything about bicycles. I'm J.D. Salinger. I faked my own death.

Princess Carolyn: Mr.Salinger. Such a pleasure. Princess Carolyn, big fan.

J.D. Salinger: Let me guess, Catcher in the Rye?

Princess Carolyn: And others. I wanna say The Hobbi—

J.D. Salinger: Nope.

Princess Carolyn: Look. I'm an agent. It doesn't matter whether I've read your work. What matters is I can look you in the eye and tell you I'm A big fan. The world is ready for your comeback, and I wanna help.

J.D. Salinger: No, thank you. Not interested. Did that before, didn't work out well. Fans were relentless. The critics were cruel. And that's why my motto is, "It's better to be alone." Which, come to think of it, is probably why I don't sell a lot of tandem bicycles.

Princess Carolyn: But, J.D.Salinger, you are J.D. Salinger. You are a goddamn American treasure.

J.D. Salinger: But every time I go out in the world, people hound me about my books. Well, book.

Princess Carolyn: What if I told you there was a place where no one reads books?

J.D. Salinger: I'm listening.

Princess Carolyn: A place where people only read headlines, lists and pictures. A place where people hate reading so much, they hire others to do it for them and don't even pay a living wage.

J.D. Salinger: What do you mean, like, modern reading slaves?

Princess Carolyn: Exactly. And all those modern reading slaves really wanna be doing is writing things that, one day, other people will also avoid reading.

J.D. Salinger: Does such a place truly exist?

Princess Carolyn: Come with me, J.D. Salinger. Let's go to Hollywoo.

    BoJack's House 

BoJack: Hup! Oh—Hey.

Wanda: Hey.

BoJack: We need to talk.

Wanda: Okay.

BoJack: You're probably wondering what this beautiful mahogany box is.

Wanda: I wasn't wondering that.

BoJack: It's my auto-erotic asphyxiation kit. I've decided—to do the funky Spider Man.

Wanda: What? Funky Spider Man?

BoJack: I came up with that one myself. It's because he hangs, then he shoots webbing.

Wanda: Wait. Are you saying you want to auto-erotic asphyxiate yourself?

BoJack: Yes. I do. Even though it's very dangerous and I could die.

Wanda: Oh.

BoJack: Now, if you love me, you probably wouldn't want me to do it—

Wanda: Okay. I get it.

BoJack: — but since you don't, I should do it, right? I mean, there's no reason not to— unless you love me.

Wanda: Do it.

BoJack: Wait. Seriously?

Wanda: Seems like you've already made up your mind. If you're that set on it, knock yourself out.

BoJack: (chuckles) Only if I do it wrong. Because as I mentioned before, it's very dangerous.

Wanda: Have fun.

BoJack: I'm serious. I'm really gonna do it.

Wanda: Great. Put a towel down. Not one of the good ones.

    LATER 

Both: (on TV, Unison) Morning time, Hollywoo.

A Ryan: I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.

An Actress or Something: And I'm An Actress Or Something, I don't know, sitting in for Some Lady.

A Ryan: Whoa! What happened to her?

An Actress or Something: She got kidnapped.

A Ryan: Oh, boy. (chuckles) Oh, my. Ooh, wow.

Wanda: Oh, hey. Look who survived to masturbate another day.

BoJack: Well, I didn't do it yet, obviously. If I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna go all out. A big job like that needs lumber, and pulleys, lemons, so forth. I'm not gonna half-ass anything. This is my orgasm we're talking about.

Wanda: Okay. Well, I wish you all the best.

BoJack: Not too late to stop me.

Wanda: I'm not gonna stop you.

BoJack: Good 'cause don't.

Wanda: All right, we're in agreement.

Todd: Stop fighting! Can't you two see what this is doing to me? I've been acting out.

Wanda: Have a great day.

BoJack: Todd? Get in the car. It's time to get serious about auto-erotic asphyxiation.

Todd: Hooray! —Question mark?

    LOWERS (Hardware Store) 

BoJack: Just play it cool, Todd. No one needs to know why we're here. Excuse me, I'm looking for something that will hold up a lot of weight. Let's say something that could hoist up a horse comfortably by the neck. Not for suicide purposes. I'm trying to have a more fulfilling orgasm.

    VIGOR 

Princess Carolyn: The world wept when news broke that J.D. Salinger died.

Wanda: J.D. Salinger died?

Princess Carolyn: But I'm here to tell you, he didn't die.

Wanda: J.D. Salinger didn't die?

Princess Carolyn: As one of the 20th century's most celebrated authors, J.D. Salinger has inspired countless dreamers, eighth graders and occasionally, assassins. His spare lyricism and devotion to character will undoubtedly translate into a penetrating dramatic work for this, the golden age of television writing. J.D. Take it away.

J.D. Salinger: I wanna do a show where people ask celebrities trivia questions.

Princess Carolyn: What?

Wanda: Like a game show?

J.D. Salinger: Yeah. You know because since they're famous people, I think normal people would wanna see if they know trivia and stuff. You know, like, Hollywoo stars and celebrities, what do they know? Do they know things? Let's find out.

Wanda: What a hoot. I love it, and I don't use that word with just anybody. What do you call it?

J.D. Salinger: I call it "Hollywoo Stars and What Do They Know? Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out."

Princess Carolyn: It's maybe more of a working title.

Wanda: I can see it on the marquee already.

Princess Carolyn: Boy, must be a long marquee.

Wanda: It's long.

J.D. Salinger: Yeah, yeah. The celebrities can also do physical challenges.

Wanda: Oh, it's perfect. We've been searching for a companion for "Hey, I Think You Can Dance." But wait, wait one second. Who's gonna host?

Princess Carolyn: Huh. I've got the perfect guy.

    SHOE-STORE 

Mr. Peanutbutter: Who wants to be in Nike Airs? Claire, you are looking off the charts "gorge" in those tennis shoes. But would you like to buy a towel? Because I'm throwing one in for free.

J.D. Salinger: He's perfect.

Princess Carolyn: Mm-hm. Mr.Peanutbutter? How would you like to be the host of J.D. Salinger's new celebrity game show?

Mr. Peanutbutter: What?! I knew destiny had a plan for me. You know, it just goes to show, with the right attitude, every single one of your dreams will always come true. And if your dreams don't come true, it's probably because you just didn't have the right attitude.

    VIGOR 

Mr. Witherspoon: Today, one agent did something that no one else could. I'll give you two hints: catcher and rye.

Princess Carolyn: Oh. Nothing. It's nothing.

Mr. Witherspoon: Charley Witherspoon caught a rye bagel coming out of the toaster.

Princess Carolyn: Come again?

Charley: It was coming fast and hot.

Mr. Witherspoon: One day, some genius will invent some sort of bagel catcher that takes the guesswork out of this task, but until then, Charley gets a gold star.

Charley: Thanks, Dad. I mean, Mr.Dad.

Princess Carolyn: Oh—

    BoJack's House 

Wanda: Oh, boy. Hey. Wasn't sure if I'd see you.

BoJack: Still alive? Because auto-erotic asphyxiation is so risky? Well, here I am, for now.

Wanda: BoJack— Wait. Did you fix the bed?

BoJack: Yeah. Well, I was at the hardware store picking up supplies for my auto-erotic asphyxiation machine. Because, as you are aware, I'm preparing to auto-erotic asphyxiate myself and I figured I'd get stuff for the bed too, so at least you could get a good night's sleep.

Wanda: Okay, BoJack, do you wanna talk about the elephant in the room?

Elephant: Wow. Okay. You know what? You know what? Here's— First of all— Wow. All right, I can't even— You know what? I— Wow.

BoJack: He is never gonna forget that.

Wanda: What is this all about?

BoJack: This isn't about anything but the pursuit of the kind of orgasm that feels like a rainbow with every color.

Wanda: So, a regular rainbow.

BoJack: No. So, if you don't mind, as long as you don't love me, I have a noose to step into. I just need to release this lever, drop these bags of sand, which act as counterweights, and then just pull this nozzle. Perfect.

Wanda: Okay. Have fun.

BoJack: Wait, Wanda.

Wanda: Okay, fine, you stupid baby. I love you.

BoJack: I—I knew— it.

Wanda: But I'm not going to tell you not to do the funky Spider-Man.

BoJack: What?

Wanda: You need to be responsible for yourself.

BoJack: That doesn't sound like me.

Wanda: I know. But if you love me, too, you won't do it.

BoJack: (sighs)

Wanda: I thought so.

BoJack: Okay. Just for the record, I never really wanted to do this in the first place, So me not doing it is not a sign that I love you. It's just because I'm a coward.

Wanda: Okay.

BoJack: I don't love you.

Wanda: Sure, you don't.

BoJack: I don't. Come back here. I don't love you. You don't make me feel less broken.

    VIGOR 

Princess Carolyn: I don't get it. I single-handedly got a Lady Footlocker store employee a prime-time show and resurrected a certified dead man and nobody cared. Why do I do anything?

Rutabaga: Hey. Do you need the movie star speech?

Princess Carolyn: (sighs) Yeah.

Rutabaga: Okay. Carolyn, you are the star of a movie and this is the part of the movie where you get your heart broken. Where the world tests you, and people treat you like shit. But it has to happen this way. Otherwise, the end of the movie, when you get everything you want, won't feel as rewarding. There are assholes out there, but in the end, they don't matter. Because this movie's not about them. It's never been about them. All this time, the movie's been about you.

Princess Carolyn: Thanks.

Rutabaga: Carolyn?

Princess Carolyn: Yes, Rutabaga?

Rutabaga: I think Katie and I are getting a divorce.
